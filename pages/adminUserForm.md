## Component Overview

### **AdminUserForm** Component

The **AdminUserForm** is a class-based React component that extends `Component`. It orchestrates the form rendering and logic for adding or modifying admin user details.

## State Management

- **userId**: User ID of the admin.
- **errorMsg**: Holds any error messages.
- **countries, options**: Arrays to store country and group options.
- **assignedPermissionLists**: List of permissions assigned to the user.
- **form fields**: Fields such as firstName, lastName, email, etc.

## Lifecycle Methods

### **componentDidMount**

    <AvField name="firstName" label="First Name*" placeholder="Enter first name here" 
             type="text" value={this.state.firstName} onChange={this.handleChange} 
             validate={{ required: { value: true, errorMessage: "First name is required" } }} />

    <!-- Additional fields follow a similar structure -->

    <Button type="submit" color="primary" className="ms-1" disabled={this.state.isLoading}> Submit </Button>
</AvForm>
```
