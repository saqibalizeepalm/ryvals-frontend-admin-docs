# Documentation for `StandingsTab.jsx`

## Overview
The `StandingsTab.jsx` file is a React component that renders the standings of a tournament. It displays the rankings of teams, the number of kills, and their scores in a tabular format. If the standings are not yet available, it informs the user that the standings are not available.

## Component Details

### Import Statements
- **React**: The core library for building the component.
- **Card, CardBody, Row**: Components from `reactstrap` used for layout and styling.
- **StandingsTable**: A custom component that displays the standings in a table format.

### Component: `StandingsTab`

#### Props
- **standingsDetails**: An array that contains details of the standings such as team rankings, number of kills, and scores.

#### Structure
- The component is wrapped in a `Card` from `reactstrap` for a structured layout.
- Inside the `CardBody`, a `Row` is used to vertically align the content.
- Depending on the content of `standingsDetails`, the component either displays the `StandingsTable` or a message indicating that standings are not available.

#### Conditional Rendering
- **Standings Available**: If `standingsDetails` contains data, it renders the `StandingsTable` component.
- **Standings Not Available**: If `standingsDetails` is empty, it renders a message saying "Standings not available yet".

### Usage
This component is used in a tournament management application to display the current standings based on the data passed to it. It is typically part of a larger interface where users can view various aspects of a tournament.

### Code Example
```jsx
import React from "react";
import { Card, CardBody, Row } from "reactstrap";
import StandingsTable from "../Table/StandingsTable";

const StandingsTab = ({ standingsDetails }) => {
  return (
    <Card className="mb-0">
      <CardBody>
        <Row>
          {standingsDetails?.length === 0 ? (
            <Card className="mb-0">
              <CardBody>
                <Row>Standings not available yet</Row>
              </CardBody>
            </Card>
          ) : (
            <StandingsTable standingsDetails={standingsDetails} />
          )}
        </Row>
      </CardBody>
    </Card>
  );
};

export default StandingsTab;
```

## Key Points
- **Responsive Design**: Utilizes `reactstrap` components to ensure the layout is responsive and consistent with other parts of the application.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Efficiently checks the availability of data before rendering the `StandingsTable`.
- **Reusability**: By using the `StandingsTable` component, the `StandingsTab` promotes reusability and separation of concerns.

This component is crucial for users who need to track the performance and rank of teams in an ongoing or completed tournament. It fits seamlessly into a larger dashboard or detailed view of tournament information.
