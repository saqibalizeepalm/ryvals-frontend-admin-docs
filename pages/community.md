## Overview

The **CommunityList.js** file is responsible for rendering a list of communities fetched from an API. It uses a responsive table to display the data and provides options to paginate through the entries, add new entries, edit existing ones, and delete entries. The component ensures that user permissions are respected through conditional rendering of action buttons.

---

## Component Structure

```javascript
const CommunityList = (props) => {
  // States
  const [community, setCommunity] = useState([]);
  const [isLoading, setisLoading] = useState(false);
  const [totalCount, settotalCount] = useState(null);
  const [deleteId, setDeleteId] = useState(null);
  const [deleteModal, setdeleteModal] = useState(false);
  const [disableSwal2, setDisabled2] = useState(false);
  const [pageNumber, setpageNumber] = useState(1);
  const [changePermission, setChange] = useState(false);
  const [deletePermission, setDelete] = useState(false);
  const [addPermission, setAdd] = useState(false);

  // Effects and Functions
  useEffect(() => {
    getList();
    callSetPermission();
  }, [pageNumber]);

  const getList = async () => { /* Fetch list logic */ };
  const handlePageClick = (pageNum) => { setpageNumber(pageNum); };
  const openAlert = (id) => { setDeleteId(id); setdeleteModal(true); };
  async function deleteCommunitySwal() { /* Delete logic */ }
  const closeAlert = () => { setdeleteModal(false); };

  // Rendering
  return (/* JSX code */);
};

export default CommunityList;
```

## Key Features

- **Responsive Table**: Displays community data in a responsive table format for various screen sizes.
- **Pagination**: Allows users to navigate through pages of community entries.
- **CRUD Operations**: Provides functionality to add, edit, and delete community entries.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Displays action buttons based on user permissions.
- **Loading State**: Displays a spinner while data is being fetched or actions are being processed.
- **Alerts & Notifications**: Utilizes sweet alerts for confirmation dialogs and toast notifications for success messages.

---

## Dependencies

The component relies on several dependencies for its functionality and UI:

- **React & React Hooks**: For component structure and state management.
- **Reactstrap & Bootstrap**: For UI components like buttons, cards, and grid layout.
- **React Super Responsive Table**: For a responsive table layout.
- **Sweet Alert & React Toastify**: For alerts and notifications.
- **Lodash**: For utility functions like `isEmpty`.

---

## State Management

The component uses React's `useState` hooks to manage various states:

| State Variable    | Purpose                                       |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `community`       | Stores the list of community entries.         |
| `isLoading`       | Indicates whether data is currently being loaded. |
| `totalCount`      | Stores the total number of community entries. |
| `deleteId`        | Holds the ID of a community entry to be deleted. |
| `deleteModal`     | Controls the visibility of the delete confirmation modal. |
| `disableSwal2`    | Disables the SweetAlert2 confirmation button while processing deletion. |
| `pageNumber`      | Tracks the current page number for pagination. |
| `changePermission`| Determines if the edit action is permissible. |
| `deletePermission`| Determines if the delete action is permissible. |
| `addPermission`   | Determines if the add action is permissible. |

---

## Event Handlers

- **`getList`**: Fetches the list of community entries from the API based on the current page number.
- **`handlePageClick`**: Updates the `pageNumber` state when a pagination link is clicked.
- **`openAlert`**: Opens a Sweet Alert confirmation dialog for deleting a community entry.
- **`deleteCommunitySwal`**: Handles the confirmation and deletion of a community entry.
- **`closeAlert`**: Closes the Sweet Alert dialog without taking any action.

---

## Rendering Logic

The component renders a **Breadcrumb** for navigation, a **button** to add new entries (if permitted), and a **responsive table** to display the community data. The table includes columns for:

- Serial Number
- YouTube Link
- Lobby Name
- Username
- Create Date
- Description
- Pinned Video

If the user has permissions, **Edit** and **Delete** buttons are rendered within each table row.

---

## Permissions

The component respects user permissions, which determine whether the user can:

- **Add** new community entries.
- **Edit** existing entries.
- **Delete** entries.

These permissions are checked using utility functions (`FilterPermission`, `filterOutPermissionToShowHide`) and are set during the component's mounting phase.

---

## Conclusion

The **CommunityList.js** component is a robust and flexible part of the application, providing comprehensive management of community video clips while respecting user permissions. It ensures that users have the necessary tools and feedback to interact effectively with the community data.

## Rendering the Component

The component renders a form with fields for:

- **YouTube, Twitter, Twitch links**
- **Description**
- **Lobby and Username selectors**
- **Pinned toggle switch**
- **Video preview using `ReactPlayer`**

The form uses `AvForm` and `AvField` for validated inputs, and a `Switch` component for the Pinned status.
