- **reactstrap**: For styled UI components.
- **availity-reactstrap-validation**: For form validation.
- **react-toastify**: For notifications.
- **Modal** elements from `reactstrap`: For displaying the module as a popup.

Here's a snippet of the import statements:

```javascript
import React, { useState } from "react";
import "react-super-responsive-table/dist/SuperResponsiveTableStyle.css";
import { removeSoloPlayer, removeTeam } from "../../services/lobby_api_helper";
import PropTypes from "prop-types";
import { AvForm, AvCheckboxGroup, AvCheckbox, AvGroup, AvInput, AvFeedback } from "availity-reactstrap-validation";
import { toast } from "react-toastify";
import toastrOptions from "../../helpers/toastr-options/toastr-options";
import { FormGroup, Button, ModalBody, ModalHeader } from "reactstrap";
import { removeTeamFromTournament } from "../../services/bracket_tournaments_api_helper";
```

## Props üéõÔ∏è

| Prop Name       | Type     | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `OnClose`       | function | Callback function to handle modal close action.                              |
| `OnComplete`    | function | Callback function triggered after a player/team is successfully removed.    |
| `callLobbyDetail` | function | Optional callback to refresh lobby details after a change.                   |
| `Mode`          | string   | Indicates whether the operation is for "solo", "team", or "tournament".     |
| `PlayerId`      | string   | ID of the player to be removed.                                             |
| `LobbyId`       | string   | ID of the lobby the player/team is in.                                      |
| `TeamId`        | string   | ID of the team to be removed.                                               |
| `TournamentId`  | string   | ID of the tournament from which the team is to be removed (when in "tournament" mode). |

## State Variables üìä

| State Variable | Type    | Description                                 |
|----------------|---------|---------------------------------------------|
| `showOtherBox` | boolean | Determines if the "Other" reason input box is displayed. |
| `disabled`     | boolean | Determines if the submit button is disabled. |

## Functions ‚öôÔ∏è

- **showOther()**: Toggles the visibility of the "Other" reason input box.
- **handleClose()**: Triggers the `OnClose` prop to close the modal.
- **handleValidSubmit(event, values)**: Handles the form submission, removing a player or team based on the selected reasons and mode.

### handleValidSubmit Logic

Depending on the mode (`solo`, `team`, or `tournament`), it composes the data object with appropriate IDs and reasons. It then calls the respective API helper function to perform the removal action and provides feedback via `react-toastify`.

```javascript
const handleValidSubmit = async (event, values) => {
  setDisabled(true);
  const array = values.ManualReason.length !== 0 ? [...values.MultiReason, values.otherReason] : [...values.MultiReason];

  if (props.Mode === "tournament") {
    let data = { team_id: props.TeamId, reasons: array.toString() };
    // API call for tournament removal
  } else if (props.Mode === "solo") {
    let data = { player_id: props.PlayerId, lobby_id: props.LobbyId, reason: array.toString() };
    // API call for solo player removal
  } else {
    let data = { team_id: props.TeamId, lobby_id: props.LobbyId, reason: array.toString() };
    // API call for team removal
  }
};
```

## Form Structure üìù

The form consists of:

1. **Predefined Reasons**: A series of checkboxes allowing users to select reasons like "Suspicious User", "Cheating", etc.
2. **Other Reason**: An optional text area for entering a custom reason.
3. **Submit Button**: Submits the form after validation checks.

```jsx
<AvForm onValidSubmit={(e, v) => { handleValidSubmit(e, v); }}>
  <AvCheckboxGroup inline name="MultiReason" label="Reasons">
    <div className="d-grid removePLayer">
      <AvCheckbox label="Suspicious User" value="Suspicious User" />
      <AvCheckbox label="Cheating" value="Cheating" />
      <AvCheckbox label="Fraudulent Activity" value="Fraudulent Activity" />
    </div>
  </AvCheckboxGroup>
  <AvCheckboxGroup inline name="ManualReason">
    <AvCheckbox label="Other (Max 50 characters)" value="Other" onClick={() => showOther()} />
  </AvCheckboxGroup>
  {showOtherBox && (
    <AvGroup>
      <AvInput type="textarea" name="otherReason" id="otherReason" placeholder="Type your reasons" required />
      <AvFeedback>Please type your reason</AvFeedback>
    </AvGroup>
  )}
  <FormGroup>
    <Button type="submit" color="primary" disabled={disabled}>
      {disabled && <span className="spinner-border spinner-border-sm mr-4"></span>}
      Submit
    </Button>
  </FormGroup>
</AvForm>
```

## Usage Example üåü

To use this component, you would typically render it within a modal component, passing in the necessary props for handling player or team removal.

```jsx
<RemovePlayerModule
  Mode="solo"
  PlayerId="12345"
  LobbyId="67890"
  OnClose={() => console.log("Modal closed")}
  OnComplete={() => console.log("Player/Team removed")}
/>
```

## Conclusion üìå

The **RemovePlayerModule** component is a versatile and reusable solution for managing the removal of players or teams from a lobby or tournament setting. It provides a rich user interface with validation, notifications, and a clear structure for managing different modes of operation.

# üìÑ LobbyResult.js Documentation

## Overview
The `LobbyResult.js` file is a React component responsible for displaying the results of a gaming lobby. It handles different game types and formats the data accordingly to show various statistics such as kills, winnings, assists, and more. The component is designed to be responsive, utilizing the `reactstrap` and `react-super-responsive-table` libraries for styling and layout.

- [Key Features](#key-features)
- [Component Structure](#component-structure)
- [Props](#props)
- [Sorting Logic](#sorting-logic)
- [Rendering Logic](#rendering-logic)
- [Dependencies](#dependencies)

## Key Features
- üìä Displays detailed statistics for each player/team in a lobby.
- üèÜ Sorts statistics based on different criteria such as winnings or kills.
- üéÆ Supports multiple game types, including Apex Legends and Valorant.
- üß© Uses responsive tables for a clean and accessible UI.
- üìà Handles both tournament and non-tournament data formats.

## Component Structure
The component is structured to render a table of results based on the `props` it receives. The main sections include:
1. **Data Sorting**: Depending on the game type and challenge mode, the data is sorted to highlight key statistics.
2. **Table Rendering**: Conditionally renders tables for different game types and includes specific columns relevant to each game.

## Props
The `LobbyResult` component accepts several props:

| Prop Name  | Type   | Description                                              |
|------------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `data`     | Array  | An array of player statistics to be displayed.           |
| `type`     | String | Indicates the type of lobby (e.g., "challenge").         |
| `gameData` | Object | Information about the game being played.                 |
| `isTournament` | Boolean | Determines if the lobby is a tournament.            |
| `isPPK`    | Boolean | Indicates if the game format is "Points Per Kill".      |

## Sorting Logic
The component applies different sorting logic based on the game and challenge type:
- **Challenge Mode**: Sorts by `player_winning`.
- **Valorant**: Sorts by `winnings`.
- **Default (e.g., Apex Legends)**: Sorts by `kills`.

This ensures that the most relevant statistics are highlighted for each game type.

## Rendering Logic
The rendering logic is dependent on the `props` and game type:
- For **challenge** type, a table with columns like Team Name, Player Name, Kills, Winnings, etc., is rendered.
- For **Apex Legends** and **Valorant**, specific headers and columns are used based on predefined arrays from `../../helpers/util`.
- For other games, a generic table structure is applied, including survival time and assists.

### Example Table Rendering
```jsx
<table className="table results-table table-striped table-bordered lobbies-table responsiveTable">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Team Name</th>
      <th>Player Name</th>
      <th>Kills</th>
      <th>Winnings</th>
      <th>Assists</th>
      <th>Damage Dealt</th>
      <th>Survival Time</th>
      <th>Platform</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    {/* Data rows */}
  </tbody>
</table>
```

## Dependencies
- **React**: Core library for building the component.
- **Reactstrap**: Provides Bootstrap components as React components.
- **react-super-responsive-table**: Ensures tables are responsive across different devices.

This component is a key part of the lobby results management, allowing users to see the outcomes of their competitive matches effectively. It is designed to be flexible and accommodate various game types and formats.

                    </Card>
                </Col>
            </Row>
        </div>
    </React.Fragment>
);
```

## Permissions Handling

The component checks user permissions to determine which actions are available, such as adding or editing lobbies. It filters permissions based on game types and user roles.

## Filtering and Sorting

The component features dropdowns for filtering the lobby list by game name, lobby type, game type, and status. It also includes sorting options to order lobbies by start date.

## PropTypes

The component expects `props.permission` as input to handle permissions.

```javascript
LobbyList.propTypes = {
    permission: PropTypes.array,
};
```

## Conclusion

The `LobbyList.js` component is a sophisticated part of a gaming platform that facilitates lobby management. It incorporates dynamic filtering, sorting, and permission-based actions to provide a comprehensive interface for users to interact with game lobbies efficiently.
