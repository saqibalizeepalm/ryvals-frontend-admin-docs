## Installation

To use this component, ensure you have the `react-select` library installed in your project:

```bash
npm install react-select
```

---

## Purpose

The **CustomSelect** component is used to provide a dropdown menu in a React application. It extends the functionality of the `react-select` component by allowing an "Select All" option, which enables users to select all available options in the dropdown at once.

---

## Component Explanation

The **CustomSelect** component is a functional component in React. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

- **Import Statements**
  - Imports necessary modules and components, including React, PropTypes for type-checking, and the `react-select` component.

- **CustomSelect Component**
  - The component checks if the `allowSelectAll` prop is true. If so, it prepends an "Select All" option to the list of options.
  - Uses the `onChange` handler to manage the selection logic. If the "Select All" option is selected, it selects all available options.
  - Renders a `ReactSelect` component with the provided props and manages its state and behavior.

---

## Props

The **CustomSelect** component accepts the following props:

| Prop           | Type                       | Default                             | Description                                                                                |

| `value`        | `any`                      | `undefined`                         | The current selected value(s) in the dropdown.                                             |
| `onChange`     | `func`                     | `undefined`                         | Callback function triggered when the selection changes.                                    |
| `closeMenu`    | `func`                     | `undefined`                         | Callback function to close the menu.                                                       |
| `allowSelectAll` | `bool`                  | `false`                             | If true, adds an "Select All" option to the dropdown.                                      |
| `allOption`    | `shape` (label, value)     | `{ label: "Select all", value: "*"}`| Defines the label and value for the "Select All" option.                                   |

];

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [selectedOptions, setSelectedOptions] = useState([]);

  const handleChange = (selected) => {
    setSelectedOptions(selected);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My Custom Select</h1>
      <CustomSelect
        options={options}
        value={selectedOptions}

  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```
