## Imports

The file begins with a series of imports that bring in necessary modules and components:

```javascript
import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { Row, Col, Card, CardBody, FormGroup, Button } from "reactstrap";
import { AvForm, AvField } from "availity-reactstrap-validation";
import Breadcrumbs from "../../components/Common/Breadcrumb";
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";
import Loader from "../../components/Common/Loader";
import { toast } from "react-toastify";
import toastrOptions from "../../helpers/toastr-options/toastr-options";
import { editBanCountry, deleteCountryState } from "../../services/complaint_user_api_helper";
import { getStates } from "../../services/config_api_helper";
import { Multiselect } from "multiselect-react-dropdown";
import whiteCrossIcon from "../../assets/images/white-cross-icon.svg";
import { SUCCESS_MESSAGES } from "../../helpers/StringConstant";
```

### Key Imports:

- **React and Hooks**: For creating and managing the component's lifecycle and state.
- **Reactstrap Components**: For UI layout and form handling.
- **Availity Form Components**: For form validation.
- **Router and Navigation**: For navigation between pages.
- **Loader and Toast Notification**: For user feedback on form submission and loading states.
- **API Helpers**: For interacting with backend services to update or delete location data.
- **Multiselect Dropdown**: For selecting multiple states in the form.

## Component State

The component maintains several pieces of state:

- **`isLoading`**: Tracks whether a loading operation is in progress.
- **`state`**: Stores the list of states associated with the selected country.
- **`isDisabled`**: Determines whether the submit button should be disabled.
- **`addMoreState`**: Keeps track of states added or removed from the selection.

```javascript
const [isLoading, setIsloading] = useState(false);
const [state, setState] = useState([]);
const [isDisabled, setIsDisabled] = useState(true);
const [addMoreState, setAddMoreState] = useState([]);
```

## Lifecycle Methods

### useEffect

The `useEffect` hook is used to fetch the initial list of states when the component mounts:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  getStateList(data.country_id);
}, []);
```

## Event Handlers

### handleValidSubmit

Handles form submissions. It checks if any states are selected and makes the appropriate API call to update or delete states:

```javascript
const handleValidSubmit = async (event, values) => {
  event.preventDefault();
  if (addMoreState.length === 0) {
    showLoader(true);
    await deleteCountryState(data.country_id).then((res) => {
      showLoader(false);
      toast.success(SUCCESS_MESSAGES.deletedSuccess, toastrOptions);
      goToListing();
    }, (err) => {
      showLoader(false);
    });
  } else {
    let model = {
      country_id: data.country_id,
      location_id: addMoreState,
      location_type: "state",
    };
    showLoader(true);
    await editBanCountry(model, data.country_id).then((_) => {
      showLoader(false);
      toast.success(SUCCESS_MESSAGES.updateSuccess, toastrOptions);
      goToListing();
    }, (err) => {
      showLoader(false);
    });
  }
};
```

### checkMultiSelectState and onRemoveState

These functions manage the state selection for the multiselect dropdown:

```javascript
const checkMultiSelectState = (selectedList, selectedItem) => {
  setAddMoreState(Array.isArray(selectedList) ? selectedList.map((x) => x.id) : []);
  setIsDisabled(false);
};

const onRemoveState = (selectedList, removedItem) => {
  setAddMoreState(Array.isArray(selectedList) ? selectedList.map((x) => x.id) : []);
  setIsDisabled(false);
};
```

## Helper Functions

### getStateList

Fetches the list of states for a given country:

```javascript
const getStateList = async (id) => {
  await getStates(id).then((res) => {
    setState(res);
  });
};
```

### getMultiStateNames

Maps state IDs to names for pre-selection in the multiselect dropdown:

```javascript
const getMultiStateNames = (options, values) => {
  const finall = [];
  options.map((opt) => {
    for (let i = 0; i < values.length; i++) {
      if (values[i].state_id === opt.id) {
        finall.push({ name: opt.name, id: opt.id });
      }
    }
  });
  return finall;
};
```

## Render Method

The component renders a form that allows users to edit the states associated with a country. It includes a breadcrumb for navigation, a loader for visual feedback during operations, and a form with validation to ensure user inputs are correct.

```javascript
return (
  <React.Fragment>
    <Loader showLoader={isLoading} />
    <div className="page-content">
      <Breadcrumbs breadcrumbItem={" Edit location"} />
      <Row>
        <Col lg={12}>
          <Card>
            <CardBody>
              <Row className="mb-4">
                <Col>
                  <p>

                      <i className="mdi mdi-arrow-left"></i> back
                    </Link>
                  </p>
                </Col>
              </Row>
              <Row>
                <Col className="col-8">
                  <AvForm onValidSubmit={(e, v) => { handleValidSubmit(e, v); }}>
                    <div className="mb-3">
                      <AvField name="country" label="Country*" placeholder="Enter country here" type="input" value={data.country_name} disabled ></AvField>
                    </div>
                    <div className="mb-3">
                      <label>State</label>
                      <Multiselect placeholder="Select state" options={state} displayValue="name" onSelect={checkMultiSelectState} onRemove={onRemoveState} selectedValues={getMultiStateNames(state, data.all_states)} customCloseIcon={<img alt="white-cross-icon" className="whiteCrossIcon" src={whiteCrossIcon} />} />
                    </div>
                    <FormGroup className="mt-4">
                      <div>
                        <Button type="submit" color="primary" className="ms-1" disabled={isDisabled ? isDisabled : isLoading}> Submit </Button>
                      </div>
                    </FormGroup>
                  </AvForm>
                </Col>
              </Row>
            </CardBody>
          </Card>
        </Col>
      </Row>
    </div>
  </React.Fragment>

---

## State Management

The component uses React's `useState` hook to manage various pieces of state:

- **`counrtyList`**: Stores the list of banned countries retrieved from the server.
- **`isLoading`**: A boolean that indicates whether the data is still being fetched.
- **`selectedCountryName`**: Stores the ID of the country selected for deletion.
- **`deleteModal`**: Controls the visibility of the delete confirmation modal.
- **`totalCount`**: Tracks the total number of countries for pagination.
- **`pageNumber`**: Stores the current page number in the pagination.
- **Permissions**: (`changePermission`, `deletePermission`, `addPermission`) Boolean flags to control permission-based UI elements.

---

## Lifecycle Methods

The `useEffect` hook is used to trigger side effects:

- **Initial Load**: Fetches the banned countries list when the component mounts or the `pageNumber` changes.
- **Permissions Setup**: Sets user permissions based on props passed to the component.

---

## Key Functions

- **`getBannedCountry`**: Asynchronously fetches the list of banned countries from the API and updates the state.
- **`handlePageClick`**: Updates the `pageNumber` state when a new page in the paginator is selected.
- **`openAlert`**: Opens the delete confirmation modal for a selected country.
- **`deleteCountryName`**: Deletes a selected country and updates the list after successful deletion.
- **`closeAlert`**: Closes the delete confirmation modal.

---

## UI Rendering

The component utilizes `reactstrap` components to layout the page and `react-super-responsive-table` to display the list of countries and states:

- **Breadcrumb**: Provides navigational context.
- **Table**: Displays the list of banned countries and states.
- **Buttons**: Allow navigation to add/edit locations and trigger delete actions.
- **Paginator**: Manages pagination of the table view.
- **SweetAlert**: Confirms delete actions with the user.

---

## Permissions

Permissions are handled using flags (`changePermission`, `deletePermission`, `addPermission`) which are set based on user roles and passed permissions. These control the visibility of certain UI elements like the "Edit" and "Delete" buttons, ensuring that only authorized users can perform specific actions.
