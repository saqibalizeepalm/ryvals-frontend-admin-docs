  delete tempObj?.obj1?.gameNew;
  delete tempObj?.obj1?.game?.rules;
  delete tempObj?.obj1?.game?.min_players;
  delete tempObj?.obj1?.game?.max_players;
  delete tempObj?.obj1?.optionGroup;
  delete tempObj?.obj1?.editSubmitDisable;
  delete tempObj?.obj1?.admins;
  delete refTempObj?.obj2?.optionGroup;

  delete refTempObj?.obj2?.editSubmitDisable;
  delete refTempObj?.obj2?.admins;
};
```

### üî¢ Parse Integer Keys for Comparison

Converts certain keys in an object to integers to facilitate accurate comparisons.

```javascript
export const parseIntKeysForCompare = (obj) => {
  obj["maxPlayer"] = parseInt(obj["maxPlayer"]);
  obj["minPlayer"] = parseInt(obj["minPlayer"]);
  obj["entryFee"] = parseInt(obj["entryFee"]);
};
```

### ‚úÇÔ∏è Trim Object Keys for Comparison

Trims whitespace from specific string keys in an object.

```javascript
export const trimObjectKeysForCompare = (obj) => {
  obj.stats_code = obj?.stats_code?.trim();
  obj.participant_code = obj?.participant_code?.trim();
  obj.admin_code = obj?.admin_code?.trim();
  obj.name = obj?.name?.trim();
};
```

## üìú Introduction

**LobbyForm.js** is a React component managing the user interface for adding and editing game lobbies. It provides various form fields for lobby settings, integrates with several APIs for data retrieval, and manages state transitions effectively. It uses libraries such as `reactstrap`, `react-select`, and `react-flatpickr` for UI components and date handling.

## üì¶ Dependencies

The component leverages several external libraries and internal modules:

| Dependency | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `React` | Core library for building UI components. |
| `reactstrap` | Provides Bootstrap 4 components as React components. |
| `react-select` | Flexible select input control for React. |
| `react-flatpickr` | A lightweight datepicker component. |
| `react-toastify` | For displaying toast notifications. |
| `lodash` | A utility library providing functions for common programming tasks. |
| `react-router-dom` | For navigation and routing in React components. |
| `react-redux` | Official React bindings for Redux to connect component with the Redux store. |

### Class Component

The `LobbyForm` component is a class-based React component extending `React.Component`.

## üß† State Management

### State Variables

The component's state holds various properties essential for form data, UI state, and logic flow:

- **isLoading**: A boolean to show or hide the loader.
- **editMode**: Determines if the form is in edit mode.
- **lobbyId**: Stores the ID of the lobby being edited.
- **optionGroup**: List of options for games or modes.
- **errorMsg**: Stores error messages for display.
- **gameNew**: Tracks the newly selected game.
- **gameTypeMode**: Holds the selected game type.
- **minPlayer, maxPlayer**: For managing player limits.
- **startDate, startTime, endTime**: Handles date and time for the lobby.
- **rules**: Stores the game rules entered by the user.
- **admin_id**: Tracks the selected admin.
- **isPasswordProtected**: Boolean to toggle password protection.
- **displayRules**: Raw HTML content for rules.
  
...and many more, ensuring comprehensive control of form inputs and logic.

## ‚è≥ Lifecycle Methods

- **constructor**: Initializes state and binds event handlers.
- **componentDidMount**: Fetches initial data like admin list and global settings.
- **componentDidUpdate**: Responds to changes in props or state to trigger methods like `subtractMinutesModeChange`.

## üîß Event Handlers

The component includes numerous event handlers to manage form interactions:

- **handleChange**: Handles changes to form fields.
- **handleValidSubmit**: Logic for submitting valid form data.
- **handleInvalidSubmit**: Handles form submission errors.
- **handleSelectGroup**: Updates state on game selection changes.
- **handleAdminSelectGroup**: Updates state when an admin is selected.
  
...and more to provide a seamless form input experience.

## üñº Render Method

The `render` method builds the UI structure using JSX:

- Utilizes `AvForm` and `AvField` for form validation.
- Includes interactive elements like `Select` for dropdowns, `Flatpickr` for date/time input, and `Switch` for toggle inputs.
- Provides buttons for actions like "Submit" and "Generate Password".
- Integrates `Loader` for asynchronous operations and `Breadcrumbs` for navigation.

## üîó Connected Redux State

The component connects to the Redux store to access the global `game` state:

```javascript
const mapStateToProps = (state) => {
    const newGameObj = { ...state.Games?.game, modeObj: { ...state.Games?.game.modeObj } };
    return { game: newGameObj };
};

export default withRouter(connect(mapStateToProps)(LobbyForm));
```

## üõ† Utility Functions

The component imports and utilizes several utility functions from `data.js` and other helper files:

- **convertTime12To24**: Converts 12-hour time format to 24-hour format.
- **parseIntKeysForCompare**: Parses numeric values for comparison.
- **removeNotValidKeysForComparison**: Cleans objects by removing unnecessary keys.
- **trimObjectKeysForCompare**: Trims whitespace from object keys.
- **randomPasswordGenerator**: Generates a random password.

## ü§î Conclusion

The **LobbyForm.js** component is a robust and interactive form for managing gaming lobbies. It effectively uses React's class component structure, manages state, integrates with APIs, and ensures user-friendly form interactions. The component's architecture supports extensibility and maintenance, making it a crucial part of the application.
