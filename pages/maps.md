## Overview

The **SimpleMap.js** file is designed to display a straightforward map with a single marker using the **Leaflet.js** library wrapped in React components via **React-Leaflet**. The map centers on a predefined location and provides mapping via OpenStreetMap tiles.

## Installation

Make sure you have the following installed to use this component:
- React
- React-Leaflet
- Leaflet

To install these dependencies, you can use:

```shell
npm install react react-dom react-leaflet leaflet
```

## Components

### Map Initialization

The main component `SimpleMap` extends from `React.Component`, initializing the map's state with default latitude, longitude, and zoom level. This state is used to center the map.

```javascript
state = {
  lat: 51.505,
  lng: -0.09,
  zoom: 13,
}
```

- **Latitude**: `51.505`
- **Longitude**: `-0.09`
- **Zoom**: `13`

The position is derived from the state and is used to set the center of the map:

```javascript
const position = [this.state.lat, this.state.lng]
```

### Tile Layer

The `TileLayer` component is responsible for loading and displaying tile layers on the map. Here, it uses tiles from OpenStreetMap with appropriate attribution.

```javascript
<TileLayer
  attribution='&amp;copy <a href="http://osm.org/copyright">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors'
  url="https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png"
/>
```

### Marker

A `Marker` is placed at the position specified by the state. This marker does not have a popup or any additional functionality but serves as a placeholder for further enhancements.

```javascript
<Marker position={position}></Marker>
```

## Customization

To customize the map, you can:
- Change the initial `lat`, `lng`, and `zoom` in the state to different values to center the map on a different location.
- Modify the `TileLayer` URL to use different map tiles.
- Add more markers or interactive elements like `Popup` or `Tooltip` for enhanced user interaction.

## Conclusion

The **SimpleMap.js** file is an excellent starting point for anyone looking to implement basic map functionality in their React application using Leaflet. With a few lines of code, it sets up a fully functional map that can be easily expanded to include more sophisticated features.

Feel free to dive into the code, experiment with different settings, and tailor it to fit your specific needs. Happy mapping! üåçüó∫Ô∏è

const lightData = {
  Data: [
    {
      featureType: "water",
      elementType: "geometry",
      stylers: [
        { color: "#e9e9e9" },
        { lightness: 17 }
      ],
    },
    // ...additional styles
  ]
}
```
