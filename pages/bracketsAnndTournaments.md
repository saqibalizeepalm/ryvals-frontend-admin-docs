# Documentation for `useStateWithCallback.jsx` üìÑ

## Overview

The `useStateWithCallback.jsx` file introduces a custom React Hook that enhances the built-in `useState` hook by adding the ability to perform a callback after the state has been updated. This functionality is particularly useful when you need to execute a side-effect or perform an operation immediately after the state change.

## Table of Contents

1. [Introduction](#introduction)
2. [Usage](#usage)
3. [API](#api)
4. [Example](#example)
5. [Conclusion](#conclusion)

## Introduction

The `useStateWithCallback` hook is designed to work similarly to React's `useState`, but with an added feature: it allows you to pass a callback function that runs after the state value has been updated. This can be beneficial in scenarios where you need to ensure that certain actions are performed after a state change.

## Usage

To use this custom hook, you need to import it into your component and use it just like the traditional `useState`. However, when updating the state, you have the option to pass a callback function that will be executed after the state has been updated.

## API

### `useStateWithCallback(initialValue)`

- **Parameters:**
  - `initialValue`: The initial state value.

- **Returns:**
  - An array containing:
    1. The current state value.
    2. A function to update the state and optionally execute a callback.

### `setValueAndCallback(newValue, callback)`

- **Parameters:**
  - `newValue`: The new state value to be set.
  - `callback`: An optional function that receives the previous and new value as arguments, executed after the state is updated.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the `useStateWithCallback` hook in a React component:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { useStateWithCallback } from './useStateWithCallback';

const ExampleComponent = () => {
  const [counter, setCounter] = useStateWithCallback(0);

  const handleClick = () => {
    setCounter(counter + 1, (prevValue, newValue) => {
      console.log(`Counter changed from ${prevValue} to ${newValue}`);
    });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Counter: {counter}</p>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default ExampleComponent;
```

### Explanation:

- **Initial State:** The counter is initialized to `0`.
- **State Update with Callback:** When the "Increment" button is clicked, the `counter` state is incremented by 1. After updating, a callback logs the transition of the counter value from its previous state to the new state.

## Conclusion

The `useStateWithCallback` hook is a powerful tool for managing state changes with side effects in React components. By providing a callback mechanism, it allows developers to ensure certain operations are executed immediately after a state update, improving the control and predictability of component behavior.

Feel free to integrate this custom hook into your projects to enhance state management capabilities where needed! üöÄ

# Documentation: `PPKTeamTable.jsx`

The `PPKTeamTable.jsx` file is a React component that displays a table of teams participating in a PPK (Player vs Player Knockout) tournament round. The table highlights the winning teams using a tick icon.

## Table of Contents
- [Component Overview](#component-overview)
- [Props](#props)
- [Structure](#structure)
- [Rendering Logic](#rendering-logic)
- [Styling](#styling)
- [Usage Example](#usage-example)

## Component Overview

The `PPKTeamTable` component is designed to render a list of teams within a structured table format. It provides a simple visual indication of which teams are winners by appending a tick icon next to their names.

## Props

The component expects the following props:

| Prop Name | Type   | Description                               |
|-----------|--------|-------------------------------------------|
| `teams`   | Array  | An array of team objects, each containing details about the team, such as its name and whether it's a winner. |

## Structure

The component structure is as follows:

- A main container `div` with classes for styling and layout purposes.
- A responsive table that adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring the component is user-friendly on mobile devices.
- Table headers and body are organized within a standard HTML `<table>` structure.

## Rendering Logic

1. **Table Headers**: The table consists of a single header column labeled "Team Name".
2. **Table Body**:
   - Iterates over the `teams` array.
   - Each team is displayed in a table row with the team's name.
   - If a team is a winner (`is_winner` is `true`), a tick icon is displayed next to the team's name.

Here is a snippet that showcases the rendering logic for team rows:

```jsx
<tbody>
  {teams && teams.map((item, index) => {
    return (
      <tr key={index}>
        <td className={item.is_winner ? 'text-capitalize winner' : 'text-capitalize'}>
          {item.name} 
          {item.is_winner ? <img src={tick} alt="tick" className="win"/> : null}
        </td>
      </tr>
    );
  })}
</tbody>
```

## Styling

- **Table Styling**: The table uses the class `ppk-table` along with other utility classes for consistent styling and layout.
- **Responsive Design**: Wrapped within a `div` that uses classes for ensuring responsiveness (`table-rep-plugin`, `table-responsrowspanive`).
- **Winner Highlight**: The class `winner` is applied to winning teams, and a tick icon is displayed using an image (`tick`) imported from assets.

## Usage Example

To use the `PPKTeamTable` component, import it and provide the `teams` prop with the appropriate data structure:

```jsx
import PPKTeamTable from './PPKTeamTable';

// Sample usage
const teamsData = [
  { name: "Team A", is_winner: true },
  { name: "Team B", is_winner: false },
  // ...other teams
];

<PPKTeamTable teams={teamsData} />
```

This component is especially useful in scenarios where tournament results need to be displayed, providing a clear and concise view of participating teams and their statuses.

            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th scope="col" rowSpan="2"> Username </th>
                <th scope="col" rowSpan="2"> Player Rank </th>
              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              {players && players.map((item, index) => {
                return (
                  <tr key={index}>
                    <td className="text-capitalize">{item.username}</td>
                    <td className="text-capitalize"> {item.player_rank || "NA"} </td>
                  </tr>
                );
              })}
            </tbody>
          </table>
        </div>
      </div>

### Props

- **players**: An array of objects, where each object represents a player with at least the properties `username` and `player_rank`. Example:
  ```json
  [
    {
      "username": "Player1",
      "player_rank": "1"
    },

```jsx
import PlayersRankInfoTable from "./PlayersRankInfoTable";

const playersData = [
  { username: "Player1", player_rank: 1 },
  { username: "Player2", player_rank: 2 },
  { username: "Player3", player_rank: null }
];

<PlayersRankInfoTable players={playersData} />;
```

This will render a table with the usernames and ranks of the players provided in the `playersData` array.
