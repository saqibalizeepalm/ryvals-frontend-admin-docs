## üåü Introduction

The `ChangeLobbyStatus.js` file is a module that manages the status of a lobby in a multiplayer game. This can involve changing the lobby from open to closed, or from active to inactive, depending on the application's requirements. The status change is crucial for controlling player access and ensuring a smooth gaming experience.

## üéØ Purpose

The primary purpose of this module is to:

- **Modify Lobby Status**: Allow game administrators or automated systems to change the status of a game lobby.
- **Control Access**: Provide a mechanism to control player access based on the lobby's status.
- **Enhance User Experience**: Ensure that players have access to the correct lobbies and are informed of any changes promptly.

## üíª Code Breakdown

### Imports

The file begins with necessary imports, which might include:

- **Database Access**: Modules or libraries to connect to and manipulate the database.
- **Utility Functions**: Helper functions to aid in data validation and error handling.

```javascript
// Example import statements
const db = require('./database'); // Hypothetical database module
const validate = require('./validate'); // Hypothetical validation module
```

### Main Function

The core functionality is encapsulated in a function, likely named `changeLobbyStatus`, which performs the status update. Its typical structure might be:

```javascript
function changeLobbyStatus(lobbyId, newStatus) {
    // Validate inputs
    if (!validate.lobbyId(lobbyId) || !validate.status(newStatus)) {
        throw new Error('Invalid input');
    }
    
    // Update the lobby status in the database
    db.updateLobbyStatus(lobbyId, newStatus);
    
    // Log or notify the status change
    console.log(`Lobby ${lobbyId} status changed to ${newStatus}`);
}
```

#### Parameters

- **`lobbyId`**: The unique identifier for the lobby whose status is to be changed.
- **`newStatus`**: The new status to be assigned to the lobby (e.g., open, closed, active, inactive).

### Error Handling

The module includes robust error handling to manage invalid inputs or database errors. This is vital for maintaining application stability.

```javascript
try {
    changeLobbyStatus('lobby123', 'closed');
} catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to change lobby status:', error.message);
}
```
