## Introduction

The `contacts.js` file is designed to handle user information within an application. It comprises of two main components:

1. **Users Array**: A list of user objects, each containing details about individual users.
2. **User Profile Object**: A detailed profile of a specific user with additional information and history.

These components are utilized to store and manage user-related data such as contact details, job roles, skills, projects, and more.

## Users Array

The `users` array contains multiple user objects, each representing a person with specific attributes. This list can be used to display user directories, manage contact lists, or integrate with other parts of an application requiring user data.

### User Object Structure

Each user object contains the following properties:

| Property    | Type     | Description                                                                          |
|-------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `id`        | Number   | A unique identifier for the user.                                                    |
| `name`      | String   | The user's full name.                                                                |
| `designation` | String | The job title or role of the user.                                                   |

| `email`     | String   | The user's email address.                                                            |
| `projects`  | String   | The number of projects the user is involved in.                                      |
| `skills`    | Array    | A list of skills or tools the user is proficient in, represented as an array of objects with `name` properties. |
| `img`       | String   | (Optional) The filename for the user's avatar image.                                 |

## Exported Components

The `contacts.js` file exports the following components for use in other parts of the application:

- **`users`**: An array of user objects.
- **`userProfile`**: A detailed profile object of a user.

By exporting these components, other modules within the application can easily import and use the user data as needed.

```javascript
export { users, userProfile }
```
