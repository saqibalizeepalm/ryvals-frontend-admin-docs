# üìÑ index.js Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the **index.js** file! This file serves as a central export point for various modules used in a JavaScript application. It facilitates the easy and organized import of different components into other parts of the app. Below is a detailed breakdown of its structure and functionality.

## üîç Overview

The **index.js** file is designed to gather and re-export modules from other files, particularly `calender.js` and `tasks.js`. This approach aids in maintaining a clean and manageable code structure by providing a single entry point for importing the necessary modules.

---

## üß© Code Explanation

Here is the entire code for the **index.js** file:

```javascript
// import React from "react"
import { calenderDefaultCategories, events } from "./calender"
import { tasks } from "./tasks"

export { events, calenderDefaultCategories, tasks }
```

### Key Components:

- **Imports**: 
  - The file imports specific modules from `calender.js` and `tasks.js`. Commented out is an import statement for React, indicating that this file might be used in a React environment, though React is not explicitly needed here.

- **Exports**: 
  - It exports three modules: `events`, `calenderDefaultCategories`, and `tasks`. This export structure allows other files in the project to import these modules from a single location, simplifying the import process.

## üì¶ Modules Exported

Below are the modules exported by **index.js**:

| Module                   | Description                                                  |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **events**               | Contains event data, possibly for calendar functionalities.  |
| **calenderDefaultCategories** | Includes default categories for calendar events.             |
| **tasks**                | Represents task-related data, details defined in `tasks.js`. |

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage Example

To use any of the exported modules from this file in another part of your application, you can simply import them as shown below:

```javascript
import { events, calenderDefaultCategories, tasks } from './path/to/index.js'

// Example usage
console.log(events);
console.log(calenderDefaultCategories);
console.log(tasks);
```

This approach streamlines the import process, making it more efficient to manage dependencies across larger projects.

Thank you for referring to the **index.js** documentation. This file is crucial for managing the imports and exports of various functionalities within the JavaScript application, contributing to a more organized and maintainable codebase.
