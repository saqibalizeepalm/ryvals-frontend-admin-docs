## üåü Introduction

The **OffSymbol.jsx** file contains a React functional component named `OffSymbol`. This component is a simple UI element designed to represent an 'Off' or 'inactive' state through the word "No". It is styled to fit consistently within a layout that might require such an indication. This component is typically used in user interfaces where a binary or toggle state needs to be displayed, such as in switch buttons or indicators.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Component Overview

The **OffSymbol** is a functional React component that returns a styled `div` element with the text "No". It visually represents an 'off' state in applications.

---

## üîç Code Breakdown

Here's a detailed look at the code:

```jsx
export const OffSymbol = () => {
  return (
    <div
      style={{
        display: "flex",
        justifyContent: "center",
        alignItems: "center",
        height: "100%",
        fontSize: 12,
        color: "#fff",
        paddingRight: 2,
      }}
    >
      {" "}
      No
    </div>
  );
};
```

- **Export**: The component is exported as a named export, allowing it to be imported elsewhere using curly braces.
- **Return Statement**: The component returns a JSX `div`, which is styled inline with several CSS properties.

## üé® Styling

The component is styled using an inline style object within the JSX. Below is a breakdown of the styling:

| CSS Property         | Value     | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `display`            | `flex`    | Enables Flexbox layout for the `div`, allowing for easy alignment of contents. |
| `justifyContent`     | `center`  | Centers the text horizontally within the `div`.                              |
| `alignItems`         | `center`  | Centers the text vertically within the `div`.                                |
| `height`             | `100%`    | Ensures the `div` takes the full height of its container.                   |
| `fontSize`           | `12`      | Sets the font size of the text to 12 pixels.                                |
| `color`              | `#fff`    | Sets the text color to white, ensuring it stands out against darker backgrounds. |
| `paddingRight`       | `2`       | Adds a small padding to the right of the text, providing slight spacing.    |

## üåü Introduction

The `OnSymbol.jsx` and `OffSymbol.jsx` files contain React components that visually represent "On" and "Off" states through text. They are lightweight, reusable components designed to be used in various parts of a web application wherever such binary state representation is needed.

---

## üìÇ File Descriptions

### `OnSymbol.jsx`

```jsx
export const OnSymbol = () => {
  return (
    <div
      style={{
        display: "flex",
        justifyContent: "center",
        alignItems: "center",
        height: "100%",
        fontSize: 12,
        color: "#fff",
        paddingRight: 2,
      }}
    >
      {" "}
      Yes
    </div>
  );
};
```

- **Purpose**: This component renders a div containing the text "Yes", symbolizing an "On" state.
- **Return**: It returns a JSX element styled to be centered and visually distinct.

### `OffSymbol.jsx`

```jsx
export const OffSymbol = () => {
  return (
    <div
      style={{
        display: "flex",
        justifyContent: "center",
        alignItems: "center",
        height: "100%",
        fontSize: 12,
        color: "#fff",
        paddingRight: 2,
      }}
    >
      {" "}
      No
    </div>
  );
};
```

- **Purpose**: This component renders a div containing the text "No", symbolizing an "Off" state.
- **Return**: It similarly returns a JSX element with aligned and formatted text.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Component Structure

Both components are built using React's functional component syntax. They utilize inline styling to achieve their visual appearance. Here's a breakdown of their structure:

- **Functional Component**: Defined using ES6 arrow functions.
- **JSX**: Returns a div containing either "Yes" or "No."
- **Inline Styling**: Styles are applied directly to the div element using the `style` attribute.

---

## üîß Usage

To use these components in a React application, you can import and include them within your JSX as shown below:

```jsx
import { OnSymbol } from './OnSymbol';
import { OffSymbol } from './OffSymbol';

const MyApp = () => (
  <div>
    <OnSymbol />
    <OffSymbol />
  </div>
);
```

---

## üé® Styling Details

The inline styles applied to both components ensure they are:

- **Flex**: The display is set to `flex` for easy alignment.
- **Centered**: Both horizontal and vertical centering is achieved with `justifyContent` and `alignItems`.
- **Responsive**: `height: 100%` ensures they take up the available space.
- **Text Styling**: Font size is set to 12, with a white color (`#fff`) for contrast.
- **Padding**: Right padding of 2 units is applied for spacing.

| Property         | Value                   | Description                                |
|------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `display`        | `flex`                  | Enables flexbox layout.                    |
| `justifyContent` | `center`                | Centers content horizontally.              |
| `alignItems`     | `center`                | Centers content vertically.                |
| `height`         | `100%`                  | Fills up the container's height.           |
| `fontSize`       | `12`                    | Font size set to 12 units.                 |
| `color`          | `#fff`                  | Sets text color to white.                  |
| `paddingRight`   | `2`                     | Adds a small padding on the right.         |
