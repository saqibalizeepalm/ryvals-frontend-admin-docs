# Documentation for `actionTypes.js` üìÑ

Welcome to the documentation for the `actionTypes.js` file. This file plays a critical role in defining the action types used in a Redux application. By understanding the contents and purpose of this file, developers can better manage and maintain their application's state management system. Let's dive into the details!

## Overview

The `actionTypes.js` file is a part of the Redux architecture, which is commonly used in React applications for state management. This file defines constants that represent the types of actions that can be dispatched in the application. By using constants, we reduce the likelihood of typos and ensure consistency across the application.

### Purpose

- **Consistency**: Action types are used across multiple files. Defining them in one location ensures that they are consistent and reduces the risk of errors.
- **Maintainability**: Having a single source of truth for action types makes it easier to update and maintain the application.
- **Scalability**: As the application grows, new action types can be easily added to this file.

## Key Components

The file defines the following action types related to the "Forget Password" functionality of the application. Let's explore each of these:

### Action Types üìã

| Action Type                   | Description                                                                                  |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `FORGET_PASSWORD`             | This action type is dispatched when the user initiates the password recovery process.        |
| `FORGET_PASSWORD_SUCCESS`     | This action type is dispatched when the password recovery process completes successfully.    |
| `FORGET_PASSWORD_ERROR`       | This action type is dispatched when there is an error during the password recovery process.  |

### Code Explanation

Let's take a closer look at the code:

```javascript
export const FORGET_PASSWORD = "FORGET_PASSWORD";
export const FORGET_PASSWORD_SUCCESS = "FORGET_PASSWORD_SUCCESS";
export const FORGET_PASSWORD_ERROR = "FORGET_PASSWORD_ERROR";
```

- **Exported Constants**: Each of the above lines exports a constant representing an action type. These constants are strings, which serve as identifiers for the specific actions in the application.

- **Naming Convention**: The action types follow a clear and descriptive naming convention. The names are all uppercase, which is a common practice to differentiate them from other variables and make them easily recognizable.

## Usage

These action types are typically used in the following parts of a Redux application:

- **Actions**: Functions that create and return action objects. These objects include a `type` property set to one of the action types defined in this file.

  ```javascript
  // Example usage in an action
  export const forgetPassword = (email) => ({
    type: FORGET_PASSWORD,
    payload: { email },
  });
  ```

- **Reducers**: Functions that determine how the application's state changes in response to actions. They use the action types to identify which logic to execute.

  ```javascript
  // Example usage in a reducer
  case FORGET_PASSWORD_SUCCESS:
    return {
      ...state,
      isLoading: false,
      successMessage: action.payload.message,
    };
  ```

- **Sagas**: Middleware functions that handle side effects. They listen for specific action types and execute asynchronous code.

  ```javascript
  // Example usage in a saga
  function* watchForgetPassword() {
    yield takeEvery(FORGET_PASSWORD, handleForgetPassword);
  }
  ```

## Conclusion

The `actionTypes.js` file is a simple yet powerful component of a Redux application. By defining action types in a centralized location, developers can ensure consistency and reduce errors. This file sets the foundation for the application's state management, making it more maintainable and scalable.

# üìÑ Actions.js Documentation

This document provides a detailed explanation of the `actions.js` file. This file is a crucial part of Redux and its purpose is to define action creators that facilitate the flow of data between the application and the Redux store. Specifically, it concerns actions related to the process of forgetting a password.

## üìú Overview

The `actions.js` file utilizes **Redux** action types defined in `actionTypes.js`. The action creators are functions that return action objects, which are then dispatched to the Redux store to update the state based on the user's interaction with the application.

### üöÄ Action Creators

The file defines three main action creators related to the forget password process:

1. **userForgetPassword**
2. **userForgetPasswordSuccess**
3. **userForgetPasswordError**

### ‚öôÔ∏è Import Statements

```javascript
import { FORGET_PASSWORD, FORGET_PASSWORD_SUCCESS, FORGET_PASSWORD_ERROR } from "./actionTypes";
```

The above import statement brings in the action types from `actionTypes.js`. These constants are used to define the type of each action creator.

### üõ†Ô∏è Action Creators

Below is a detailed explanation of each action creator:

1. **userForgetPassword**

    ```javascript
    export const userForgetPassword = (user, history) => {
      return {
        type: FORGET_PASSWORD,
        payload: { user, history },
      }
    }
    ```

    - **Purpose**: Initiates the forget password process.
    - **Parameters**:
      - `user`: The user object containing information (e.g., email) needed to reset the password.
      - `history`: The history object from React Router, used to navigate programmatically.
    - **Returns**: An action object with type `FORGET_PASSWORD` and a payload containing the user and history.

2. **userForgetPasswordSuccess**

    ```javascript
    export const userForgetPasswordSuccess = message => {
      return {
        type: FORGET_PASSWORD_SUCCESS,
        payload: message,
      }
    }
    ```

    - **Purpose**: Handles successful password reset processes.
    - **Parameters**:
      - `message`: A success message to be displayed to the user.
    - **Returns**: An action object with type `FORGET_PASSWORD_SUCCESS` and a payload containing the success message.

3. **userForgetPasswordError**

    ```javascript
    export const userForgetPasswordError = message => {
      return {
        type: FORGET_PASSWORD_ERROR,
        payload: message,
      }
    }
    ```

    - **Purpose**: Handles errors that occur during the password reset process.
    - **Parameters**:
      - `message`: An error message to be displayed to the user.
    - **Returns**: An action object with type `FORGET_PASSWORD_ERROR` and a payload containing the error message.

## üìö Conclusion

The `actions.js` file plays a pivotal role in managing the state related to the password reset process. By defining action creators, it allows for the decoupling of logic and state management, leading to a more modular and maintainable codebase. Through these action creators, the application can effectively communicate what changes need to occur in the Redux store based on user interactions.

### Reducer Function

- **`forgetPassword`**
  - **Parameters**:
    - `state`: The current state of the reducer, initialized with `initialState`.
    - `action`: The action dispatched to the reducer.
  - **Switch Cases**:
    - **`FORGET_PASSWORD`**: Resets both `forgetSuccessMsg` and `forgetError` to `null` as the process begins.
    - **`FORGET_PASSWORD_SUCCESS`**: Updates the `forgetSuccessMsg` with the message from the action's payload.
    - **`FORGET_PASSWORD_ERROR`**: Updates `forgetError` with the error message from the action's payload.
    - **`default`**: Returns the current state if no relevant action type is matched.
  - **Returns**: The updated state based on the action type.

### Usage Example

```javascript
import forgetPassword from './reducer';

// Initial state
let state = forgetPassword(undefined, {});
console.log(state); // { forgetSuccessMsg: null, forgetError: null }

// Dispatch a success action
state = forgetPassword(state, userForgetPasswordSuccess('Password reset successful!'));
console.log(state); // { forgetSuccessMsg: 'Password reset successful!', forgetError: null }

// Dispatch an error action
state = forgetPassword(state, userForgetPasswordError('Error resetting password.'));
console.log(state); // { forgetSuccessMsg: 'Password reset successful!', forgetError: 'Error resetting password.' }
```

# Documentation for Forget Password Module

This documentation provides a detailed overview of the Forget Password functionality implemented across four key files: `actionTypes.js`, `actions.js`, `reducer.js`, and `saga.js`. Each file plays a specific role in handling the forget password process within a React-Redux application.

## **1. actionTypes.js**

### **Purpose**

This file defines constants that represent the action types for handling the forget password process. These constants are used to identify the specific actions dispatched to the Redux store.

### **Code Explanation**

```javascript
export const FORGET_PASSWORD = "FORGET_PASSWORD";
export const FORGET_PASSWORD_SUCCESS = "FORGET_PASSWORD_SUCCESS";
export const FORGET_PASSWORD_ERROR = "FORGET_PASSWORD_ERROR";
```

- **FORGET_PASSWORD**: This action type is dispatched when a user initiates the forget password process.
- **FORGET_PASSWORD_SUCCESS**: This action type is dispatched when the forget password request is successful, and the user receives a reset link.
- **FORGET_PASSWORD_ERROR**: This action type is dispatched when there is an error during the forget password request.

## **2. actions.js**

### **Purpose**

This file defines action creators for the forget password process. These functions create actions that are dispatched to the Redux store.

### **Code Explanation**

```javascript
import { FORGET_PASSWORD, FORGET_PASSWORD_SUCCESS, FORGET_PASSWORD_ERROR } from "./actionTypes";

export const userForgetPassword = (user, history) => {
  return {
    type: FORGET_PASSWORD,
    payload: { user, history },
  };
};

export const userForgetPasswordSuccess = message => {
  return {
    type: FORGET_PASSWORD_SUCCESS,
    payload: message,
  };
};

export const userForgetPasswordError = message => {
  return {
    type: FORGET_PASSWORD_ERROR,
    payload: message,
  };
};
```

- **userForgetPassword**: Creates an action to initiate the forget password process, carrying the user data and navigation history as payload.
- **userForgetPasswordSuccess**: Creates an action indicating the forget password request was successful, carrying a success message.
- **userForgetPasswordError**: Creates an action indicating there was an error in the forget password request, carrying an error message.

## **3. reducer.js**

### **Purpose**

This file implements the reducer function that updates the Redux store based on the actions dispatched during the forget password process.

### **Code Explanation**

```javascript
import { FORGET_PASSWORD, FORGET_PASSWORD_SUCCESS, FORGET_PASSWORD_ERROR } from "./actionTypes";

const initialState = {
  forgetSuccessMsg: null,
  forgetError: null,
};

const forgetPassword = (state = initialState, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case FORGET_PASSWORD:
      state = {
        ...state,
        forgetSuccessMsg: null,
        forgetError: null,
      };
      break;
    case FORGET_PASSWORD_SUCCESS:
      state = {
        ...state,
        forgetSuccessMsg: action.payload,
      };
      break;
    case FORGET_PASSWORD_ERROR:
      state = {
        ...state,
        forgetError: action.payload
      };
      break;
    default:
      state = { ...state };
      break;
  }
  return state;
};

export default forgetPassword;
```

- **Initial State**: The initial state includes `forgetSuccessMsg` and `forgetError`, both initialized to `null`.
- **FORGET_PASSWORD**: Resets the success message and error to `null`.
- **FORGET_PASSWORD_SUCCESS**: Updates the state with a success message from the action payload.
- **FORGET_PASSWORD_ERROR**: Updates the state with an error message from the action payload.

## **4. saga.js**

### **Purpose**

This file implements Redux-Saga middleware to handle side effects for the forget password process, such as making asynchronous API calls.

### **Code Explanation**

```javascript
import { takeEvery, fork, put, all, call } from "redux-saga/effects";
import { FORGET_PASSWORD } from "./actionTypes";
import { userForgetPasswordSuccess, userForgetPasswordError } from "./actions";
import { getFirebaseBackend } from "../../../helpers/firebase_helper";
import { postFakeForgetPwd, postJwtForgetPwd } from "../../../helpers/fakebackend_helper";

const fireBaseBackend = getFirebaseBackend();

function* forgetUser({ payload: { user, history } }) {
  try {
    if (process.env.REACT_APP_DEFAULTAUTH === "firebase") {
      const response = yield call(fireBaseBackend.forgetPassword, user.email);
      if (response) {
        yield put(userForgetPasswordSuccess("Reset link are sent to your mailbox, check there first"));
      }
    } else if (process.env.REACT_APP_DEFAULTAUTH === "jwt") {
      const response = yield call(postJwtForgetPwd, "/jwt-forget-pwd", { email: user.email });
      if (response) {
        yield put(userForgetPasswordSuccess("Reset link are sent to your mailbox, check there first"));
      }
    } else {
      const response = yield call(postFakeForgetPwd, "/fake-forget-pwd", { email: user.email });
      if (response) {
        yield put(userForgetPasswordSuccess("Reset link are sent to your mailbox, check there first"));
      }
    }
  } catch (error) {
    yield put(userForgetPasswordError(error));
  }
}

export function* watchUserPasswordForget() {
  yield takeEvery(FORGET_PASSWORD, forgetUser);
}

function* forgetPasswordSaga() {
  yield all([fork(watchUserPasswordForget)]);
}

export default forgetPasswordSaga;
```

- **forgetUser**: A generator function handling the forget password logic. It supports different authentication methods (Firebase, JWT, Fake backend) and dispatches success or error actions based on the API response.
- **watchUserPasswordForget**: Watches for `FORGET_PASSWORD` actions and triggers `forgetUser`.
- **forgetPasswordSaga**: Combines all the sagas using `all` and `fork` to run them concurrently.

## Usage üìò

In a Redux application, action types serve as identifiers for actions. By using constants for action types, developers can avoid potential bugs that arise from using hard-coded strings throughout their application. Here's an example of how these action types might be used in an action creator:

```javascript
import { LOGIN_USER } from './actionTypes';

export const loginUser = (user, history) => {
    return {
        type: LOGIN_USER,
        payload: { user, history }
    };
};
```

## Conclusion üéâ

The `actionTypes.js` file plays a pivotal role in maintaining a clean and maintainable Redux architecture. By centralizing the action type definitions, developers can ensure that their applications remain robust, less error-prone, and easier to debug. This file acts as a dictionary of the possible actions that can occur within the application, serving as a reference for developers as they create and manage different application states.

# Documentation for `gameReducer.js` üéÆ

## Overview

The **`gameReducer.js`** file contains a Redux reducer that manages the state related to game data within an application. This reducer is responsible for handling actions that update the list of games and their associated categories. It listens for specific action types to update the state accordingly.

## Contents

- **Initial State**: Defines the structure of the initial state for games.
- **Reducer Function**: Handles state changes based on dispatched actions.
  
## Initial State

The initial state is defined as follows:

```javascript
const initialState = {
  game: {
    ppkGames: [],        // List of Pay per Kill games
    killRaceGames: [],   // List of Kill Race games
    traditionalGames: [],// List of Traditional games
    allGames: [],        // List of all games
    modeObj: {},         // Additional game mode data
  },
};
```
  
This initial state sets up empty arrays for different categories of games, as well as an empty object for additional mode data.

## Reducer Function

### Function Signature

```javascript
const gameReducer = (state = initialState, { type, payload } = {}) => {
  ...
};
```

### Functionality

The **`gameReducer`** function takes two parameters:
- `state`: The current state of the game data, initialized to `initialState`.
- An action object containing `type` and `payload`.

### Action Handling

The `gameReducer` listens for the following action type:

- **`SET_GAMES`**: When this action is dispatched, the reducer updates the state with the new game data provided in the `payload`.

### Code Logic

```javascript
if (type === SET_GAMES) {
  return { ...state, game: payload };
} else {
  return (state = { ...state });
}
```

- **SET_GAMES**: If the action type is `SET_GAMES`, the reducer updates the `game` part of the state with the `payload`.
- **Default**: If no recognized action type is dispatched, the state remains unchanged.

## Export

The reducer is exported as the default export of the module:

```javascript
export default gameReducer;
```

This allows it to be easily imported and used in the application's Redux store setup.

## Conclusion

The **`gameReducer.js`** plays a crucial role in managing the state related to games within the application. By responding to the `SET_GAMES` action, it ensures that the game's data is kept up-to-date, reflecting any changes made elsewhere in the application. This helps maintain a consistent and responsive gaming experience for users.

# Documentation for `loginReducer.js` üìÑ

Welcome to the documentation for the **`loginReducer.js`** file, which is a part of the Redux implementation for managing the authentication state in a React application. This reducer handles actions related to user login, logout, and API errors.

## Index üìë
- [Purpose](#purpose-)
- [Initial State](#initial-state-)
- [Reducer Function](#reducer-function-)
- [Action Types](#action-types-)
- [Usage](#usage-)

## Purpose üéØ
The `loginReducer.js` file is designed to manage the state of the application's login functionality. It handles changes to the state based on different actions dispatched during the login process, such as starting a login, successful login, logging out, and handling errors.

## Initial State üå±
The reducer initializes with the following state:

```javascript
const initialState = {
  error: "",
  loading: false,
};
```

- **`error`**: A string that holds any error message encountered during login operations.
- **`loading`**: A boolean that indicates whether a login operation is in progress.

## Reducer Function ‚öôÔ∏è
The reducer function is responsible for updating the state based on the action types it receives. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

```javascript
const loginReducer = (state = initialState, { type, payload }={}) => {
  switch (type) {
    case LOGIN_USER:
      state = { ...state, loading: true };
      break;

    case LOGIN_SUCCESS:
      state = { ...state, loading: false };
      break;

    case LOGOUT_USER:
      state = { ...state };
      break;

    case LOGOUT_USER_SUCCESS:
      state = { ...state };
      break;

    case API_ERROR:
      state = { ...state, error: payload, loading: false };
      break;

    default:
      state = { ...state };
      break;
  }
  return state;
};
```

### Key Points:
- **`LOGIN_USER`**: Sets `loading` to `true` to indicate a login attempt is in progress.
- **`LOGIN_SUCCESS`**: Sets `loading` to `false` to indicate the login attempt is completed successfully.
- **`LOGOUT_USER`** and **`LOGOUT_USER_SUCCESS`**: Maintains the current state without changes. These cases could be expanded in the future to handle specific logout-related state changes.
- **`API_ERROR`**: Updates the `error` state with the error message received in the payload and sets `loading` to `false`.
- **`default`**: Returns the current state for any unhandled action types.

## Action Types üé¨
The reducer utilizes the following action types, which are imported from `actionTypes.js`:

- **`LOGIN_USER`**: Initiates the login process.
- **`LOGIN_SUCCESS`**: Indicates a successful login.
- **`LOGOUT_USER`**: Initiates the logout process.
- **`LOGOUT_USER_SUCCESS`**: Indicates a successful logout.
- **`API_ERROR`**: Handles any API errors that occur during authentication processes.

## Usage üìò
This reducer should be combined with other reducers in the application using `combineReducers` from Redux. It is connected to the Redux store to manage the login-related state.

```javascript
import { combineReducers } from 'redux';
import loginReducer from './loginReducer';

const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  login: loginReducer,
  // other reducers...
});

export default rootReducer;
```

By understanding the structure and functionality of the `loginReducer.js` file, developers can effectively manage the authentication state of their application and handle user login processes efficiently.

# Prize Reducer Documentation üìú

The `prizeReducer.js` file is part of a Redux setup in a React application and is responsible for managing the application's state related to prizes. This is crucial for maintaining and updating the prize data efficiently.

## Table of Contents
- [Overview](#overview)
- [Initial State](#initial-state)
- [Action Types](#action-types)
- [Reducer Logic](#reducer-logic)
- [Exports](#exports)

## Overview
The prize reducer handles the state of prizes for a particular feature in the application. It manages a list of prizes, updates the count of prizes, and has the ability to clear the prize list. This reducer responds to specific action types to update the state accordingly.

## Initial State

```javascript
const initialState = {
  prize: [],
  count: 0,
};
```
- **`prize`**: An empty array that will eventually hold the list of prizes.
- **`count`**: An integer that keeps track of the number of prizes.

## Action Types

The reducer listens for the following action types imported from `actionTypes.js`:

| Action Type            | Description                                   |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `SET_PRIZE_LIST`       | Sets the list of prizes.                      |
| `UPDATE_PRIZE_COUNT`   | Updates the count of prizes.                  |
| `UPDATE_PRIZE_LIST`    | Updates the prize list based on the count.    |
| `SET_CLEAR_PRIZE_LIST` | Clears the prize list and resets the count.   |

## Reducer Logic

The reducer function, `prizeReducer`, handles the state changes based on different actions dispatched:

```javascript
const prizeReducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case SET_PRIZE_LIST:
      return {
        ...state,
        prize: action === undefined ? [] : action.payload.map(({ positionLabel, ...rest }) => ({ ...rest })),
      };
      
    case UPDATE_PRIZE_COUNT:
      return {
        ...state,
        count: action.payload,
      };
      
    case UPDATE_PRIZE_LIST:
      return {
        ...state,
        prize: [...state.prize.slice(0, state.count)],
      };
      
    case SET_CLEAR_PRIZE_LIST:
      return {
        count: 0,
        prize: [],
      };
      
    default:
      state = { ...state };
      break;
  }
  return state;
};
```

### Action Handling
- **`SET_PRIZE_LIST`**: Maps the payload to remove `positionLabel` and sets the prize state.
- **`UPDATE_PRIZE_COUNT`**: Sets the `count` state with the payload.
- **`UPDATE_PRIZE_LIST`**: Slices the prize list up to the number specified in the count.
- **`SET_CLEAR_PRIZE_LIST`**: Resets the prize list and count to their initial states.

## Exports

```javascript
export default prizeReducer;
```

The `prizeReducer` function is exported as the default export. This function will be combined with other reducers in the Redux store configuration.

## Conclusion

The `prizeReducer.js` file is a crucial part of the Redux architecture, enabling the application to manage prize data effectively. By handling specific actions, it ensures the correct state transitions necessary for application functionality. üéâ

## File: actions.js

This file defines action creator functions, which return action objects. These actions are dispatched to the Redux store to alter the state.

### Action Creators

```javascript
import { LOGIN_USER, LOGIN_SUCCESS, LOGOUT_USER, LOGOUT_USER_SUCCESS, API_ERROR, SOCIAL_LOGIN, SET_GAMES, SET_PRIZE_LIST, SET_SCHEDULE_LIST, SET_SCHEDULE_COUNT, SET_CLEAR_PRIZE_LIST, UPDATE_PRIZE_COUNT, UPDATE_PRIZE_LIST, UPDATE_SCHEDULE_LIST, SET_CLEAR_SCHEDULE_LIST, } from "./actionTypes";

export const loginUser = (user, history) => ({
    type: LOGIN_USER,
    payload: { user, history },
});

export const loginSuccess = (user) => ({
    type: LOGIN_SUCCESS,
    payload: user,
});

export const logoutUser = (history) => ({
    type: LOGOUT_USER,
    payload: { history },
});

export const logoutUserSuccess = () => ({
    type: LOGOUT_USER_SUCCESS,
    payload: {},
});

export const apiError = (error) => ({
    type: API_ERROR,
    payload: error,
});

export const socialLogin = (data, history, type) => ({
    type: SOCIAL_LOGIN,
    payload: { data, history, type },
});

export const setGames = (data) => ({
    type: SET_GAMES,
    payload: gamesToCategories(data),
});

export const setPrizeList = (prizeList) => ({
    type: SET_PRIZE_LIST,
    payload: prizeList,
});

export const setClearPrizeList = () => ({
    type: SET_CLEAR_PRIZE_LIST,
    payload: {},
});

export const updatePrizeCount = (prizeCount) => ({
    type: UPDATE_PRIZE_COUNT,
    payload: prizeCount,
});

export const updatePrizeList = () => ({
    type: UPDATE_PRIZE_LIST,
});

export const setScheduleList = (scheduleList) => ({
    type: SET_SCHEDULE_LIST,
    payload: scheduleList,
});

export const setScheduleCount = (scheduleCount) => ({
    type: SET_SCHEDULE_COUNT,
    payload: scheduleCount,
});

export const updateScheduleList = () => ({
    type: UPDATE_SCHEDULE_LIST,
});

export const setClearScheduleList = () => ({
    type: SET_CLEAR_SCHEDULE_LIST,
    payload: {},
});
```

These action creators provide a standardized way to trigger state changes in response to user interactions in the application.

## File: saga.js

This file contains the saga function that handles side effects related to user authentication using Redux-Saga.

### Saga Functionality

```javascript
import { put, takeEvery } from "redux-saga/effects";
import { LOGIN_USER } from "./actionTypes";
import { apiError } from "./actions";
import axios from "axios";

function* loginUser({ payload: { user, history } }) {
    try {
        const body = {
            email: user.email,
            password: user.password,
        };
        const url = process.env.REACT_APP_APIURL + "login/";
        const isProduction = process.env.REACT_APP_PRODUCTION === "true" ? true : false;
        let headers;
        if (!isProduction) {
            headers = {
                Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.REACT_APP_CLIENTTOKEN}`,
                "Content-Type": "application/json",
            };
        }
        axios
            .post(url, body, { headers })
            .then((res) => {
                localStorage.setItem("authUser", JSON.stringify(res.data));
                history.push("/users");
            })
            .catch((err) => {
                put(apiError(err));
            });
    } catch (error) {
        yield put(apiError(error));
    }
}

function* authSaga() {
    yield takeEvery(LOGIN_USER, loginUser);
}

export default authSaga;
```

#### Key Points

- **`loginUser` Generator Function**: Handles the login process by making an API call. It uses Axios to send a POST request with user credentials. On success, it stores the `authUser` data in local storage and redirects the user. On failure, it dispatches an API error action.

- **`authSaga` Generator Function**: Watches for `LOGIN_USER` actions and triggers the `loginUser` function.

This saga ensures that side effects like API calls are managed efficiently and that asynchronous workflows are properly handled within the Redux environment.

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the files involved in managing authentication in a Redux-Saga setup, detailing each file's purpose and functionality in the authentication flow.

# Documentation for `reducer.js`

This document provides a comprehensive guide to the `reducer.js` file, which is a part of a Redux setup for managing authentication state in a React application.

## Overview üìÑ

In Redux, a **reducer** is a pure function that determines changes to an application's state. In this particular file, the reducer is responsible for handling state changes related to user authentication actions such as login, logout, and handling API errors. 

## Initial State üå±

The reducer starts with the following initial state:

```javascript
const initialState = {
  error: "",
  loading: false,
}
```

- **error**: Stores any error messages that occur during the authentication process.
- **loading**: A boolean indicating whether an authentication request is in progress.

## Actions üöÄ

The reducer responds to several action types defined in `actionTypes.js`:

- **LOGIN_USER**: Indicates a user login attempt. Sets `loading` to `true`.
- **LOGIN_SUCCESS**: Indicates a successful login. Sets `loading` to `false`.
- **LOGOUT_USER**: Indicates a user logout attempt.
- **LOGOUT_USER_SUCCESS**: Indicates a successful logout.
- **API_ERROR**: Captures any errors returned by the API. Sets `error` with the payload and `loading` to `false`.

## Reducer Function ‚öôÔ∏è

The main reducer function processes the incoming actions and updates the state accordingly:

```javascript
const login = (state = initialState, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case LOGIN_USER:
      state = { ...state, loading: true }
      break

    case LOGIN_SUCCESS:
      state = { ...state, loading: false }
      break

    case LOGOUT_USER:
      state = { ...state }
      break

    case LOGOUT_USER_SUCCESS:
      state = { ...state }
      break

    case API_ERROR:
      state = { ...state, error: action.payload, loading: false }
      break

    default:
      state = { ...state }
      break
  }
  return state
}
```

### Breakdown

- **LOGIN_USER**: When this action is dispatched, the reducer sets `loading` to `true` indicating the start of a login process.
  
- **LOGIN_SUCCESS**: On successful login, this action resets `loading` to `false`.

- **LOGOUT_USER & LOGOUT_USER_SUCCESS**: These actions don't alter the state in this implementation but are placeholders for any potential state changes needed during logout.

- **API_ERROR**: This action captures error messages and stops the loading process by setting `loading` to `false`.

## Export üì§

The reducer is exported as the default export of the module:

```javascript
export default login
```

This allows it to be imported and used in the Redux store setup.

## Conclusion üéØ

The `reducer.js` file provides a simple yet crucial function in managing the authentication state within a Redux architecture. It ensures that the UI reflects the current authentication status and handles errors gracefully, providing a seamless user experience.

# üìÑ Documentation for `scheduleReducer.js`

## Overview
The `scheduleReducer.js` file contains a reducer function specifically designed to manage the state associated with schedules. In Redux, reducers are pure functions that take the previous state and an action, and return the next state. This reducer handles actions related to scheduling lists, counts, and clearing the schedule data.

## Initial State
The reducer's initial state is defined with the following properties:
- **`schedule`**: An array to hold the list of schedule items.
- **`count`**: An integer that keeps track of the number of schedule items.

```javascript
const initialState = {
  schedule: [],
  count: 0,
};
```

## Action Types
This reducer responds to several action types. These types are defined in `actionTypes.js` and imported into this file:

| Action Type              | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `SET_SCHEDULE_LIST`      | Sets the list of schedules, sorted by ID.                                   |
| `SET_SCHEDULE_COUNT`     | Sets the count of schedules.                                                |
| `UPDATE_SCHEDULE_LIST`   | Updates the list of schedules based on the current count.                   |
| `SET_CLEAR_SCHEDULE_LIST`| Clears the schedule list and resets count to zero.                          |

## Reducer Function
The main function in this file is the `scheduleReducer` which updates the state based on the dispatched action:

```javascript
const scheduleReducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case SET_SCHEDULE_LIST:
      return {
        ...state,
        schedule: action === undefined ? [] : action.payload
          .sort((a, b) => a.id - b.id)
          .map(({ id, ...rest }) => ({ ...rest })),
      };

    case SET_SCHEDULE_COUNT:
      return {
        ...state,
        count: action.payload,
      };

    case UPDATE_SCHEDULE_LIST:
      return {
        ...state,
        schedule: [...state.schedule.slice(0, state.count)],
      };

    case SET_CLEAR_SCHEDULE_LIST:
      return {
        count: 0,
        schedule: [],
      };

    default:
      state = { ...state };
      break;
  }
  return state;
};
```

### Explanation of Cases:
- **`SET_SCHEDULE_LIST`**: This case sets the `schedule` state with a sorted list of schedules by `id`. It ensures that if `action` is undefined, the schedule list is an empty array.
  
- **`SET_SCHEDULE_COUNT`**: Updates the `count` state with the payload provided in the action.
  
- **`UPDATE_SCHEDULE_LIST`**: Limits the `schedule` array to the number of items specified by `count`, effectively "trimming" the list.
  
- **`SET_CLEAR_SCHEDULE_LIST`**: Resets both the `schedule` array and `count` to their initial empty or zero states.

## Export
The `scheduleReducer` function is exported as the default export from this module, allowing it to be easily integrated into the Redux store.

```javascript
export default scheduleReducer;
```

## Summary
The `scheduleReducer.js` file plays a crucial role in managing the state of schedules in an application, enabling features such as setting, updating, and clearing schedules based on dispatched actions. Its design ensures that the state transitions are predictable and maintainable.

# Documentation for `actions.js` üöÄ

2. [Initial State](#initial-state)
3. [Reducer Function](#reducer-function)
4. [Action Types](#action-types)
5. [State Management](#state-management)
6. [Export](#export)

---

## Overview

The `reducer.js` file is responsible for handling state transitions related to user profile actions in a Redux application. It listens to specific action types and updates the state accordingly.

## Initial State

The initial state is defined at the top of the file. It sets the default values for the state attributes related to user profile actions:

```javascript
const initialState = {
  error: "",
  success: "",
}
```

- **error**: Stores any error messages resulting from profile-related actions.
- **success**: Stores success messages confirming profile updates.

## Reducer Function

The core of this file is the `profile` reducer function. This function takes the current state and an action as arguments and returns a new state based on the action type:

```javascript
const profile = (state = initialState, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case EDIT_PROFILE:
      state = { ...state }
      break
    case PROFILE_SUCCESS:
      state = { ...state, success: action.payload }
      break
    case PROFILE_ERROR:
      state = { ...state, error: action.payload }
      break
    case RESET_PROFILE_FLAG:
      state = { ...state, success: null }
      break
    default:
      state = { ...state }
      break
  }
  return state
}
```

## Action Types

The reducer function listens for several action types:

- **EDIT_PROFILE**: Triggered when a profile edit action is initiated.
- **PROFILE_SUCCESS**: Triggered when a profile edit action is successful. It updates the `success` state with a success message.
- **PROFILE_ERROR**: Triggered when a profile edit action fails. It updates the `error` state with an error message.
- **RESET_PROFILE_FLAG**: Resets the `success` state to `null`, effectively clearing the success message.

## State Management

The reducer handles the state transitions as follows:

- **EDIT_PROFILE**: Currently does not update the state, but it sets the stage for potential future enhancements.
- **PROFILE_SUCCESS**: Updates the `success` message in the state.
- **PROFILE_ERROR**: Updates the `error` message in the state.
- **RESET_PROFILE_FLAG**: Clears the `success` message by setting it to `null`.

## Export

Finally, the reducer function is exported as the default export of the module:

```javascript
export default profile
```

This allows the reducer to be integrated into the Redux store where it can handle profile-related state transitions.

# Documentation for `actionTypes.js`

This **documentation** provides a detailed explanation of the `actionTypes.js` file, which is an essential part of managing action types in a Redux-based application. This file defines constants representing various action types used throughout the application to maintain consistent and error-free action dispatching. Below, we'll delve into the specifics of each action type defined in this file, focusing particularly on user registration.

## üéØ Purpose

The `actionTypes.js` file acts as a central repository for all action type constants. By using constants, we avoid potential errors that can arise from typos in action type strings in action creators and reducers.

## üìú Action Types Defined

Here's a list of action types included in this `actionTypes.js` file:

| Action Type Constant             | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `REGISTER_USER`                  | üöÄ Dispatched when a user registration process is initiated.                 |
| `REGISTER_USER_SUCCESSFUL`       | ‚úÖ Dispatched when a user registration completes successfully.               |
| `REGISTER_USER_FAILED`           | ‚ùå Dispatched when a user registration process fails.                        |

### Detailed Explanation

- **`REGISTER_USER`**: This action type is used to indicate the start of a user registration process. It is typically dispatched by an action creator when a user submits their registration details.

- **`REGISTER_USER_SUCCESSFUL`**: This action type is dispatched upon the successful completion of the user registration process. It may carry additional payload data such as user information or confirmation messages.

- **`REGISTER_USER_FAILED`**: This action type is dispatched if the user registration process fails for any reason. It usually carries payload data containing error messages or codes.

## üìö Example Usage

These constants are used in action creators and reducers. Here's a simple example of how these might be used in an action creator:

```javascript
import { REGISTER_USER, REGISTER_USER_SUCCESSFUL, REGISTER_USER_FAILED } from './actionTypes';

// Action creator for registering a user
export const registerUser = (userData) => ({
    type: REGISTER_USER,
    payload: userData,
});

// Action creator for successful registration
export const registerUserSuccessful = (user) => ({
    type: REGISTER_USER_SUCCESSFUL,
    payload: user,
});

// Action creator for failed registration
export const registerUserFailed = (error) => ({
    type: REGISTER_USER_FAILED,
    payload: error,
});
```

## üéâ Conclusion

The `actionTypes.js` file is a crucial component in a Redux application, ensuring that action types are consistent and reducing the risk of errors. By defining action types such as `REGISTER_USER`, `REGISTER_USER_SUCCESSFUL`, and `REGISTER_USER_FAILED`, this file supports a robust user registration process, providing clear paths for success and error handling. This approach enhances the maintainability and scalability of the application.

- **registerUserFailed**: Dispatched when the registration process fails.

## Imports

```javascript
import { REGISTER_USER, REGISTER_USER_SUCCESSFUL, REGISTER_USER_FAILED } from "./actionTypes";
```

This section imports the action types from the `actionTypes.js` file. These constants are used to define the types of actions that can be dispatched in the application.

## Action Creators

### registerUser

**Definition**: 

```javascript
export const registerUser = user => {
    return {
        type: REGISTER_USER,
        payload: { user },
    };
};
```

- **Purpose**: This action creator is used to initiate the registration process for a new user. It takes a `user` object as an argument.
- **Parameters**: 
  - `user`: An object containing user details required for registration.
- **Returns**: An action object with:
  - `type`: A constant `REGISTER_USER` that identifies the action.
  - `payload`: An object containing the `user` data.

### registerUserSuccessful

**Definition**:

```javascript
export const registerUserSuccessful = user => {
    return {
        type: REGISTER_USER_SUCCESSFUL,
        payload: user,
    };
};
```

- **Purpose**: This action is dispatched when a user is successfully registered.
- **Parameters**: 
  - `user`: An object containing the registered user details.
- **Returns**: An action object with:
  - `type`: A constant `REGISTER_USER_SUCCESSFUL`.
  - `payload`: The `user` data.

### registerUserFailed

**Definition**:

```javascript
export const registerUserFailed = user => {
    return {
        type: REGISTER_USER_FAILED,
        payload: user,
    };
};
```

- **Purpose**: This action is dispatched when there is an error in the registration process.
- **Parameters**: 
  - `user`: An object or message detailing the error.
- **Returns**: An action object with:
  - `type`: A constant `REGISTER_USER_FAILED`.
  - `payload`: The error information.

## Overview

The file `reducer.js` in this module is responsible for managing the state related to user registration within a Redux store. It handles different actions to update the Redux state during the user registration process.

---

## Code Structure

The `reducer.js` file is structured to manage the registration state of a user. It imports necessary action types from the `actionTypes.js` file and defines an initial state for registration.

```javascript
import { REGISTER_USER, REGISTER_USER_SUCCESSFUL, REGISTER_USER_FAILED } from "./actionTypes";

const initialState = {
  registrationError: null,
  message: null,
  loading: false,
  user: null,
};

const account = (state = initialState, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case REGISTER_USER:
      state = {
        ...state,
        loading: true,
        registrationError: null,
      };
      break;
    case REGISTER_USER_SUCCESSFUL:
      state = {
        ...state,
        loading: false,
        user: action.payload,
        registrationError: null,
      };
      break;
    case REGISTER_USER_FAILED:
      state = {
        ...state,
        user: null,
        loading: false,
        registrationError: action.payload,
      };
      break;
    default:
      state = {
        ...state,
      };
      break;
  }
  return state;
};

export default account;
```

---

## State Management

The initial state is defined as:

- **`registrationError`**: Holds any error message that occurs during registration.
- **`message`**: Reserved for any messages that may be used (currently unused).
- **`loading`**: Boolean indicating if a registration operation is in progress.
- **`user`**: Holds user data upon successful registration.

---

## Reducers

### Action Handling

1. **`REGISTER_USER`**:
   - **Purpose**: Initiates user registration.
   - **State Changes**:
     - Sets `loading` to `true`.
     - Resets `registrationError` to `null`.

2. **`REGISTER_USER_SUCCESSFUL`**:
   - **Purpose**: Updates the state when user registration is successful.
   - **State Changes**:
     - Sets `loading` to `false`.
     - Updates `user` with the payload (user data).
     - Resets `registrationError` to `null`.

3. **`REGISTER_USER_FAILED`**:
   - **Purpose**: Updates the state when user registration fails.
   - **State Changes**:
     - Sets `user` to `null`.
     - Sets `loading` to `false`.
     - Updates `registrationError` with the payload (error message).

### Default Case

- Returns the current state when no action is matched.

---

## Conclusion

The `reducer.js` in this module is crucial for managing user registration states, providing a robust structure to handle user registration actions effectively. By updating the state based on dispatched actions, it ensures the UI reflects the current registration process, whether it is loading, successful, or failed. This reducer is a foundational piece in the user account management flow.
