## üåü Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

In a Redux application, **actions** are payloads of information that send data from your application to your Redux store. They are the only source of information for the store. You send them to the store using `store.dispatch()`.

The `actions.js` file defines several action creators related to products, orders, cart data, customers, and shops, which are essential for managing the application's state effectively.

## üìã Action Types <a name="action-types"></a>

The file imports several action types from `actionTypes.js`, which are used to differentiate between the various actions. These constants help avoid typos and provide a single source of truth for action naming.

### Example of Action Types

```javascript
import { 
  GET_CART_DATA, 
  GET_CART_DATA_FAIL, 
  GET_CART_DATA_SUCCESS, 
  GET_ORDERS, 
  GET_ORDERS_FAIL, 
  GET_ORDERS_SUCCESS, 
  GET_PRODUCTS, 
  GET_PRODUCTS_FAIL, 
  GET_PRODUCTS_SUCCESS, 
  GET_CUSTOMERS, 
  GET_CUSTOMERS_FAIL, 
  GET_CUSTOMERS_SUCCESS, 
  GET_SHOPS, 
  GET_SHOPS_FAIL, 
  GET_SHOPS_SUCCESS, 
  GET_PRODUCT_DETAIL, 
  GET_PRODUCT_DETAIL_FAIL, 
  GET_PRODUCT_DETAIL_SUCCESS 
} from "./actionTypes"
```

## üöÄ Action Creators <a name="action-creators"></a>

## Introduction
The `saga.js` file is responsible for handling side effects in a Redux application using Redux-Saga. It orchestrates asynchronous operations such as data fetching from an API, and dispatches actions depending on whether the operation was successful or failed. This file is crucial for managing complex asynchronous logic in a clear and maintainable way.

## Import Statements
The file begins by importing necessary functions and actions:

```javascript
import { call, put, takeEvery } from "redux-saga/effects"
import {
  GET_CART_DATA, GET_CUSTOMERS, GET_ORDERS, GET_PRODUCT_DETAIL, GET_PRODUCTS, GET_SHOPS,
} from "./actionTypes"
import {
  getCartDataFail, getCartDataSuccess, getCustomersFail, getCustomersSuccess,
  getOrdersFail, getOrdersSuccess, getProductDetailFail, getProductDetailSuccess,
  getProductsFail, getProductsSuccess, getShopsFail, getShopsSuccess,
} from "./actions"
import {
  getCartData, getCustomers, getOrders, getProducts, getShops, getProductDetail,
} from "../../helpers/fakebackend_helper"
```

- **`redux-saga/effects`**: Provides core Saga functionality.
- **Action Types**: Import constants to identify which actions should trigger the Sagas.
- **Action Creators**: Import functions to dispatch success or failure actions.
- **Helpers**: Import functions simulating API calls.

## Saga Functions

### fetchProducts
Handles fetching product data:

```javascript
function* fetchProducts() {
  try {
    const response = yield call(getProducts)
    yield put(getProductsSuccess(response))
  } catch (error) {
    yield put(getProductsFail(error))
  }
}
```

- **`call(getProducts)`**: Calls the `getProducts` function.
- **`put(getProductsSuccess(response))`**: Dispatches success action.
- **`catch` block**: Dispatches failure action if an error occurs.

### fetchProductDetail
Handles fetching product details:

```javascript
function* fetchProductDetail({ productId }) {
  try {
    const response = yield call(getProductDetail, productId)
    yield put(getProductDetailSuccess(response))
  } catch (error) {
    yield put(getProductDetailFail(error))
  }
}
```

- Takes a `productId` to fetch specific product details.

### fetchOrders
Handles fetching orders:

```javascript
function* fetchOrders() {
  try {
    const response = yield call(getOrders)
    yield put(getOrdersSuccess(response))
  } catch (error) {
    yield put(getOrdersFail(error))
  }
}
```

- **Similar structure** to `fetchProducts`.

### fetchCartData
Handles fetching cart data:

```javascript
function* fetchCartData() {
  try {
    const response = yield call(getCartData)
    yield put(getCartDataSuccess(response))
  } catch (error) {
    yield put(getCartDataFail(error))
  }
}
```

- **Similar structure** to `fetchProducts`.

### fetchCustomers
Handles fetching customer data:

```javascript
function* fetchCustomers() {
  try {
    const response = yield call(getCustomers)
    yield put(getCustomersSuccess(response))
  } catch (error) {
    yield put(getCustomersFail(error))
  }
}
```

- **Similar structure** to `fetchProducts`.

### fetchShops
Handles fetching shop data:

```javascript
function* fetchShops() {
  try {
    const response = yield call(getShops)
    yield put(getShopsSuccess(response))
  } catch (error) {
    yield put(getShopsFail(error))
  }
}
```

- **Similar structure** to `fetchProducts`.

## Root Saga
The `ecommerceSaga` is the root saga that listens for dispatched actions and triggers the appropriate worker saga:

```javascript
function* ecommerceSaga() {
  yield takeEvery(GET_PRODUCTS, fetchProducts)
  yield takeEvery(GET_PRODUCT_DETAIL, fetchProductDetail)
  yield takeEvery(GET_ORDERS, fetchOrders)
  yield takeEvery(GET_CART_DATA, fetchCartData)
  yield takeEvery(GET_CUSTOMERS, fetchCustomers)
  yield takeEvery(GET_SHOPS, fetchShops)
}
```

- **`takeEvery`**: Listens for every dispatched action of the specified type and runs the associated saga function.

## Conclusion
The `saga.js` is an integral part of managing asynchronous flows in a Redux application. It efficiently handles side effects and keeps the logic separated from the UI components, promoting maintainability and scalability. By leveraging Redux-Saga, developers can write complex logic in a clear and testable manner. üõ†Ô∏è

# üìö Reducer.js Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for `reducer.js`. This file is pivotal in the state management of an e-commerce application using Redux. It outlines the structure of the state and defines how the state changes in response to actions dispatched in the application. Let's dive into the details! üåü

## üéØ Purpose

The `reducer.js` file is responsible for:
- Defining the initial state of the application.
- Handling state transitions based on different action types.
- Updating the state immutably in response to successes and failures in fetching e-commerce data.

## üîç Index

- [Initial State](#initial-state)
- [Reducer Function: `Ecommerce`](#reducer-function-ecommerce)
- [Action Handlers](#action-handlers)
  - [Products](#products)
  - [Product Details](#product-details)
  - [Orders](#orders)
  - [Cart Data](#cart-data)
  - [Customers](#customers)
  - [Shops](#shops)
- [Default Case](#default-case)

## üìã Initial State

The initial state (`INIT_STATE`) is defined as a JavaScript object containing the default values for different pieces of data used in the e-commerce application.

```javascript
const INIT_STATE = {
  products: [],
  product: {},
  orders: [],
  cartData: {},
  customers: [],
  shops: [],
  error: {},
}
```

### Explanation:
- **products**: An array holding the list of products.
- **product**: An object storing details of a single product.
- **orders**: An array of customer orders.
- **cartData**: An object representing the user's cart.
- **customers**: An array of customer information.
- **shops**: An array of shop details.
- **error**: An object to capture errors from failed actions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Reducer Function: `Ecommerce`

The `Ecommerce` reducer function is the core component that manages state updates. It takes the current state and an action as arguments and returns a new state based on the action type.

```javascript
const Ecommerce = (state = INIT_STATE, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    // Action handlers
    default:
      return state
  }
}
```

## üîÑ Action Handlers

The reducer contains multiple action handlers that listen for specific action types and update the state accordingly.

### üõí Products

- **`GET_PRODUCTS_SUCCESS`**: Updates the state with the list of products.
- **`GET_PRODUCTS_FAIL`**: Captures any errors encountered when fetching products.

```javascript
case GET_PRODUCTS_SUCCESS:
  return { ...state, products: action.payload }

case GET_PRODUCTS_FAIL:
  return { ...state, error: action.payload }
```

### üìù Product Details

- **`GET_PRODUCT_DETAIL_SUCCESS`**: Stores the details of a specific product.
- **`GET_PRODUCT_DETAIL_FAIL`**: Captures errors when fetching product details.

```javascript
case GET_PRODUCT_DETAIL_SUCCESS:
  return { ...state, product: action.payload }

case GET_PRODUCT_DETAIL_FAIL:
  return { ...state, error: action.payload }
```

### üì¶ Orders

- **`GET_ORDERS_SUCCESS`**: Updates the state with customer orders.
- **`GET_ORDERS_FAIL`**: Captures errors when fetching orders.

```javascript
case GET_ORDERS_SUCCESS:
  return { ...state, orders: action.payload }

case GET_ORDERS_FAIL:
  return { ...state, error: action.payload }
```

### üõí Cart Data

- **`GET_CART_DATA_SUCCESS`**: Updates the cart data.
- **`GET_CART_DATA_FAIL`**: Captures errors when fetching cart data.

```javascript
case GET_CART_DATA_SUCCESS:
  return { ...state, cartData: action.payload }

case GET_CART_DATA_FAIL:
  return { ...state, error: action.payload }
```

### üë• Customers

- **`GET_CUSTOMERS_SUCCESS`**: Stores information about customers.
- **`GET_CUSTOMERS_FAIL`**: Captures errors when fetching customer information.

```javascript
case GET_CUSTOMERS_SUCCESS:
  return { ...state, customers: action.payload }

case GET_CUSTOMERS_FAIL:
  return { ...state, error: action.payload }
```

### üè¨ Shops

- **`GET_SHOPS_SUCCESS`**: Updates the state with shop details.
- **`GET_SHOPS_FAIL`**: Captures errors when fetching shops.

```javascript
case GET_SHOPS_SUCCESS:
  return { ...state, shops: action.payload }

case GET_SHOPS_FAIL:
  return { ...state, error: action.payload }
```

## ‚öñÔ∏è Default Case

The default case in the switch statement ensures that the state remains unchanged if an action type does not match any of the defined cases.

```javascript
default:
  return state
```

This concludes the documentation for `reducer.js`. By understanding each part, you can effectively manage the state of your e-commerce application. Happy coding! üöÄ
