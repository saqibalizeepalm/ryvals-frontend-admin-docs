# 📜 actions.js Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the **actions.js** file. This file is a crucial part of the Redux structure in a JavaScript/React application. It defines actions related to user data management, which are dispatched to modify the state within a Redux store.

## 🎯 Purpose

The **actions.js** file is responsible for defining action creators. Action creators are functions that return action objects, which are dispatched to the Redux store. These actions are used to initiate data fetching processes and handle their outcomes (success or failure).

## 🛠 How to Use

To use these action creators in your application, you typically import them into your components or sagas where you need to manage user-related data. You then dispatch these actions to the Redux store, allowing the corresponding reducers and sagas to handle state changes and side effects.

Example usage in a component:

```javascript
import { useDispatch } from 'react-redux';
import { getUsers } from './actions';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const dispatch = useDispatch();

  const fetchUsers = () => {
    dispatch(getUsers());
  };

  return (
    <button onClick={fetchUsers}>Load Users</button>
  );
};
```

This documentation provides a comprehensive insight into the action creators defined in the **actions.js** file, aiming to facilitate smooth integration and utilization within the Redux architecture. 🛠️🔧

# Documentation for `reducer.js`

Welcome to the documentation for the `reducer.js` file. This file is a crucial part of a Redux setup, responsible for managing and updating the state related to users and user profiles in the application. In this documentation, we will explore how the reducer works, its purpose, and the actions it handles.

## Overview

The **reducer** is a pure function that takes the previous state and an action, and returns the next state. This is a central concept in Redux for managing state transformations in response to dispatched actions. In this file, the reducer manages the state associated with:

- **Users**: A collection of user data.
- **User Profile**: Detailed information about a single user.
- **Error Handling**: Capturing any errors during the fetching process.

---

## Imports

```javascript
import {
  GET_USERS_SUCCESS,
  GET_USERS_FAIL,
  GET_USER_PROFILE_SUCCESS,
  GET_USER_PROFILE_FAIL,
} from "./actionTypes";
```

The reducer imports a set of action types from `actionTypes.js`. These action types are used to determine how the state should change in response to different actions dispatched in the application.

---

## Initial State

```javascript
const INIT_STATE = {
  users: [],
  userProfile: {},
  error: {},
};
```

The **initial state** (`INIT_STATE`) defines the default state of the application concerning the users and user profiles. It contains:

- **users**: An empty array meant to store user data.
- **userProfile**: An empty object meant to store detailed information about a specific user.
- **error**: An empty object to capture any errors that may occur during data fetching.

---

## Reducer Function

The core of `reducer.js` is the reducer function, defined as follows:

```javascript
const contacts = (state = INIT_STATE, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    // Cases handled by the reducer
    default:
      return state;
  }
};
```

The reducer function takes two parameters: the current `state` (defaulting to `INIT_STATE`) and an `action`. It uses a `switch` statement to determine how to update the state based on the action's `type`.

### GET_USERS_SUCCESS

```javascript
case GET_USERS_SUCCESS:
  return {
    ...state,
    users: action.payload,
  };
```

- **Purpose**: Updates the state with a new list of users.
- **Action Payload**: Contains an array of user data.
- **State Change**: Replaces the current `users` array with the new data from `action.payload`.

### GET_USERS_FAIL

```javascript
case GET_USERS_FAIL:
  return {
    ...state,
    error: action.payload,
  };
```

- **Purpose**: Handles errors that occur during the fetching of users.
- **Action Payload**: Contains the error information.
- **State Change**: Updates the `error` object with the error data from `action.payload`.

### GET_USER_PROFILE_SUCCESS

```javascript
case GET_USER_PROFILE_SUCCESS:
  return {
    ...state,
    userProfile: action.payload,
  };
```

- **Purpose**: Updates the state with detailed information about a single user.
- **Action Payload**: Contains the user's profile data.
- **State Change**: Replaces the current `userProfile` object with the new data from `action.payload`.

### GET_USER_PROFILE_FAIL

```javascript
case GET_USER_PROFILE_FAIL:
  return {
    ...state,
    error: action.payload,
  };
```

- **Purpose**: Handles errors that occur during the fetching of a user profile.
- **Action Payload**: Contains the error information.
- **State Change**: Updates the `error` object with the error data from `action.payload`.

---

## Export

```javascript
export default contacts;
```

The reducer function `contacts` is exported as the default export of the module. This allows it to be integrated into the Redux store, where it will manage the state transitions for user-related data.

---

By understanding the structure and functionality of the `reducer.js` file, developers can effectively manage state transitions related to user data in a Redux-based application. This reducer plays a key role in ensuring the application can accurately and efficiently handle user information and any associated errors.

# Redux Saga Documentation for `saga.js` 📜

## Overview 🌟

The `saga.js` file is an integral part of managing asynchronous side effects in the Redux architecture. It utilizes the `redux-saga` middleware to handle complex state transitions, such as fetching data from an API. Through generator functions, `redux-saga` allows for easy-to-read asynchronous code management. This file is specifically responsible for managing user-related data fetching operations.

## Table of Contents 📚

1. [Key Imports](#key-imports)
2. [Core Functions](#core-functions)
   - [fetchUsers](#fetchusers)
   - [fetchUserProfile](#fetchuserprofile)
3. [Saga Watcher](#saga-watcher)
4. [Export](#export)

## Key Imports 🔑

```javascript
import { call, put, takeEvery } from "redux-saga/effects"
import { GET_USERS, GET_USER_PROFILE } from "./actionTypes"
import { getUsersSuccess, getUsersFail, getUserProfileSuccess, getUserProfileFail } from "./actions"
import { getUsers, getUserProfile } from "../../helpers/fakebackend_helper"
```

- **redux-saga/effects**: Provides essential Saga effect creators like `call`, `put`, and `takeEvery`.
- **actionTypes**: Contains action type constants which are used to trigger specific Sagas.
- **actions**: Defines the action creators for dispatching success or failure states.
- **fakebackend_helper**: Simulates backend API calls for fetching data.

## Core Functions 💡

### fetchUsers

This generator function handles the asynchronous task of fetching user data.

```javascript
function* fetchUsers() {
  try {
    const response = yield call(getUsers)
    yield put(getUsersSuccess(response))
  } catch (error) {
    yield put(getUsersFail(error))
  }
}
```

- **call(getUsers)**: Calls the `getUsers` function, simulating an API request.
- **put(getUsersSuccess(response))**: Dispatches a success action if the API call is successful.
- **put(getUsersFail(error))**: Dispatches a failure action if the API call fails.

### fetchUserProfile

This generator function fetches a user's profile data.

```javascript
function* fetchUserProfile() {
  try {
    const response = yield call(getUserProfile)
    yield put(getUserProfileSuccess(response))
  } catch (error) {
    yield put(getUserProfileFail(error))
  }
}
```

- **call(getUserProfile)**: Calls the `getUserProfile` function to fetch a specific user's profile.
- **put(getUserProfileSuccess(response))**: Dispatches a success action with the user profile data.
- **put(getUserProfileFail(error))**: Dispatches a failure action with error information.

## Saga Watcher 👀

The `contactsSaga` function watches for dispatched actions and delegates them to the appropriate worker Saga.

```javascript
function* contactsSaga() {
  yield takeEvery(GET_USERS, fetchUsers)
  yield takeEvery(GET_USER_PROFILE, fetchUserProfile)
}
```

- **takeEvery**: A Saga helper that listens for specific actions (`GET_USERS`, `GET_USER_PROFILE`) and triggers corresponding worker functions (`fetchUsers`, `fetchUserProfile`).

## Export 📤

The default export of the `saga.js` file is the `contactsSaga`, which is combined with other Sagas in the application.

```javascript
export default contactsSaga
```

This export is crucial to ensure the Saga middleware is aware of these operations and can handle them as actions are dispatched throughout the application.

## Conclusion 🎯

The `saga.js` file is a well-structured component of a `redux-saga` setup, adeptly managing asynchronicity in Redux through generator functions. By dispatching actions based on API call success or failure, it ensures that our application remains responsive and efficient.
